<center>**The Bush**

<br></br>

When dawn says hello the bush sleeps sound

And dewdrops on silently snoozing leaves abound

And the humming of a bird rouses the bush awake

While all the trees take a drink from the lake

<br></br>

And all the flora wakes up to a din

From all the native fauna that live within

But as the warm yellow light envelopes the canopy tops

The overwhelming cacophony stops</center>
