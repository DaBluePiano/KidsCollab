<center>**Krill**

<br></br>

In the ocean, where they mill

Is the animal which we call krill

<br></br>

Orange sparks, through the blue

Gives the ocean a contrasting hue

<br></br>

A whale's lunch

On which they munch

They eat thousands of them each day

<br></br>

They may seem small

But they mean all

To the ocean food chain</center>
