<center>**Royal Lament**

<br></br>

Mourneth queen elizabeth II

h'r majesty f'rev'r just and true

<br></br>

Tooketh the throne at only 25

through tragedy and war hath kept joy alive

H'r gracious posture, whatev'r day it be

at each moment did inspire, did inspire thee

<br></br>

Mourneth queen elizabeth II

h'r majesty f'rev'r just and true

<br></br>

She reigned to reach her jubilee

When London’s streets were filled with glee

The palaces gates were flooded to see

The amazing, kind h’r majesty!

<br></br>

Mourneth queen elizabeth II

h'r majesty f'rev'r just and true</center>
