<br></br>

Turquoise tastes like a sea of salty water.

Turquoise looks like a gleaming patch of coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef.

Turquoise smells like the scent of ocean spray.

Turquoise sounds like the crashing waves of the high tides.

Turquoise feels like the wonderful smoothness of waters.

Turquoise is peaceful and calm.</center>
