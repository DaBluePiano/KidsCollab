<br></br>

Green taste like awful foal smelling vegetables going down your throat

Green looks like a tennis ball being hit at 200 km per hour to the serving box

Green smells like old gum tree leaves dropping from the sky

Green sounds like tennis balls dropping to the hard, synthetic surface

Green fells like the hard swing off a tennis ball going to your chest

Green is the origin of tennis</center>
