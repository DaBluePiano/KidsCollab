<center>**Grey**

<br></br>

Grey tastes like polluted water running down my throat.

Grey looks like creativity drained of everything.

Grey sounds like a withered, meaningless echo resonating in the air.

Grey feels like a smooth, cold and uninviting surface.

Grey is the doom of colours.</center>
