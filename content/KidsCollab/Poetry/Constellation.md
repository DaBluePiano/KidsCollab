<center>**Constellation**

Me, the lonely traveller in the dark night with no destination..

Shadows crawl around my path.

No moon today.

But there is still light.

How generous the stars.

The stars that release their light.

The light that travels billions of years to reach my eyes.

And then they have served their purpose.

Gone, after a billion years, to end in my eyes.

But are they?

Energy never dies, only changes.
That light in space comes to me.

That light, the lonely traveller in the dark night coming to me.

Enveloped by nothingness, isolated from everything.

They have no moon.

On my path, a boy, injured, dragging himself ahead.

Me, the lonely traveller in the night with a destination.</center>
