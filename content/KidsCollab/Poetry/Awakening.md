Awakening

<br></br>

By Nathan W
He gives a start, snorting
Stretching, his eyes open
He rises, his mind on the day ahead
He shovels food into his stale mouth
Slaps buttons to his chest
Stuffs his bag
His mum shouting loud orders
He stumbles around blindly  
A big yawn echoes in his head
time to go to school
