<center>**Train**

<br></br>

It slowly winds through forests and hills

Through baking hot deserts and northerly chills

<br></br>

It billows out a whitening hue

Through fog, mist and morning dew

<br></br>

Carrying cargo, from metal to meat

Bricks, timber, people and wheat

<br></br>

Arriving now at the station

Taking people to vacation

<br></br>

Cargo off, people on

The train goes along

The whistle tooting its song</center>
