I have more than 10 allergies.

I have asthma, eczema and a rare condition.

I’ve been in an ambulance twice, stayed in the hospital multiple times.

I’ve stopped breathing, had 10 operations, and am only 12.

Waves of pure pain have rolled through my body

Enveloping my very being

My system wracked with fire

To the point I can’t think, can’t feel

Can’t

Can’t

can’t

I close my eyes and all I see is black

The black of oblivion

And my mind betrays me when it feels

The sweet joy of nothing

But then

I think of Paralympians

And I see them

The fighters

The ones who got up

The ones who CAN even if they can’t

The ones who for every needle I’ve had

Have had a hundred

Who for every night I’ve spent in hospital

Have spent years doubting themselves

For who one step for me

Is a mile for them

Who have been stripped of ability

But fight and become better

Then me, then pain, then us

I open my eyes

And feel</center>
