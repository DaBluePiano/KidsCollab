<center>**Storm**

<br></br>

The clouds are racing

As fast as a rocket

Lightning falls to the ground with a CRASH!

Pushing puny people

This is a killer, a torturer

Its thunder is a cruel evil laugh

Booming in its wake

<br></br>

Fearful people flee

Escaping from the devil

The ground is as unsteady as a rock on a wave

The Earthâ€™s belly is rumbling

Hungry for some chaos

<br></br>

The rain falls as thick as a wall

An unprecedented shower

Hitting helpless humans

Hammering the ground

<br></br>

This storm cannot be stopped.</center>
