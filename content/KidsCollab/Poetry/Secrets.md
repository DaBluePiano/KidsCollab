<center>**Secrets**

<br></br>

The shadows

Leaps up and

Pours into your brain

Obliterates everything

You know

Smothers love

Extinguishes hope

Crushes persistence

Smashes care

And you’re left in the dark

Wondering

Pondering

Does anything not have a secret?

And even courage is not spared

Its noble actions only to impress

And you stumble

Blindly

When betrayal arrives

Stretches its long obsidian claws

And plunges deep into trust’s heart

And the last wisps of the silvery entity dissolve

And all good qualities

Dissipate from your mind

The

World

Is

Not

As

It

Seems .</center>
