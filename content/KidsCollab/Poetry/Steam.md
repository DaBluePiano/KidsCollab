<center>**Steam**

<br></br>

The mist thickens and swirls

And slowly uncurls

Twist a translucent hand

Unravels watery sand

<br></br>

Climbing softly, see how it fares

Moving up invisible stairs

It lunges up into the sky

Catching air, starts to fly

<br></br>

Born from heat, drawn to cold

Watch the wispy body unfold

Brother of smoke, nephew of fire

See it form a drifting spire

<br></br>

It holds no value, wields no power

Yet as delicate as a flower

And whenever it envelopes you

You gaze in wonder at the silvery </center>
