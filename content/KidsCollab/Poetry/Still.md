<center>**Still**

<br></br>

The poppies still bloom; the quiet waters still flow

No sign of what happened more than a hundred years ago

Where final breaths occurred, where countless lay to rest

And many of the bodies had metal in their chest

<br></br>

And still

And still

The ANZACS trudged across enemy land

Moving where now the red flowers stand

<br></br>

And now

Underneath the ground

Shells of valiant soldiers abound

Still and at peace, they have left their mark

Demonstrated bravery beyond remark

<br></br>

The poppies still bloom; the quiet waters still flow

No sign of what happened more than a hundred years ago

But still we remember those who enlisted to serve

And still their memories we willfully preserve

<br></br>

Today, for a minute, still and silent weâ€™ll stay

Today we commemorate ANZAC Day.</center>
