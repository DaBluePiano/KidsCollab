Places
The earthquake in Afghanistan caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. At least 10000 homes collapsed, schools, hospitals and more than 25 villages collapsed. Weeks of heavy rain prior to the earthquake also contributed to the weakening of the structure of homes. Many houses in Afghanistan were made primarily of wood and mud. The earthquake destroyed vital water networks, leaving many communities stranded without water. The destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and villages caused by the earthquake had a devastating impact on the affected communities. The loss of shelter and essential services such as the water further compounded the difficulties faced by those affected by the earthquake. The fact that many homes were made primarily of wood and mud, and that heavy rain had weakened their structure, likely contributed to the high level of damage. The response to the earthquake included efforts by organizations such as UNICEF and the World Food Program to provide aid to those affected, as shown in Source 2. ‘The Islamic Emirate will pay 100000 AFN ($1116.19) for the families of those who were killed in the earthquake and 50000 ($558.10) will be paid to the families of those who were injured.
