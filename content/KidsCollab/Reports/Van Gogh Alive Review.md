## Introduction

Van Gogh Alive is an immersive experience using modern day technology to glimpse into the past through the artworks of one of the most famous painters in history. Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter, who painted the famous Sunflowers and Starry Night.
The exhibition is taking place all over Australia, notably Canberra and Sydney and was on display in Canberra from mid-2022 to late-2022 and in Sydney from late-2022 to early 2023. It provides a new view to the painter’s works by incorporating technology such as screens and headphones to learn more about the maestro.

## Exhibition Description

The exhibition has multiple rooms containing screens displaying enlarged versions of famous artworks and you can wear headphones to learn more information about the process and origins needed to create the masterpieces. It runs for 45 minutes and throughout the display appeals to the sight \through the massive artworks and depth in the works and communicates to the ears due to the information you can opt to hear during the experience. The smell in the air is reminiscent of freshly drying paint like you are in the artist’s studio, and the feel of the place echoes what it must have been like in the painter’s home. The artworks are usually projected on screens - they can be next to you, above you, or even below you! You can see more than 3,000 iconic artworks and the immersive technology involved means that viewers don’t just see the artwork but rather they feel it. The artworks move with you, literally, as they sense movement and move accordingly.

## Critical Review

Van Gogh Alive really brings the viewer through the experience of seeing and hearing his biography. It gives new meaning to the artworks and they seem no longer distant, no longer untouchable, but magnificent and beautiful works by a down to earth painter. The exhibition leads to the feeling of understanding, because you see the story behind the work and finally understand what it means. There are 7 metre high images projected and screens moving below you and they immerse you in the story. This is why VoiceMag said: ‘This exhibition recreates the true experience of looking at a Van Gogh painting – one that is kinetic and emotive’ because it does. You feel the effort poured into the art and it becomes a story, ever so vibrant, just like the artist himself. I believe that the curator has performed extremely well in the interesting placement of the artworks, as it makes you look everywhere, and the decision to be able to hear the writings of the artist in headphones as it completes a sensory experience.

## Conclusion

The Van Gogh Alive Exhibition is a must-see as it changes the view of the famous painter and brings the ever iconic painter closer to the present by combining the old paintings with the new technology.
