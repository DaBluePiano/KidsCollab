Every day, the planets met to brag. “I have the fastest orbit", boasted Mercury, looking cute in his tiny body. “I am the hottest”, declared Venus through his thick accent. Mars said, "no one owns as fine dust as me”. “I am the biggest”, announced Jupiter, his big red spot enlarging. “My rings are the masterpiece of the solar system", insisted Saturn, spinning indignantly. “I am the greatest dancer", Uranus retaliated, continually breakdancing on his side. “I have the coldest surface”, shrieked Neptune from a distance.

But none of them were like Earth.

Earth was a beautiful marble with seas swirling and luscious land. It was the gem of the Galaxy, the light of the Solar System and the ruler of the Universe. Furthermore, she guarded the secret of life.

But one day, Earth started to get terribly sick. She coughed and spluttered, her seas ashen grey. There were fires and tornadoes terrorizing her land. The planet was in pieces.

No one knew how to stop it.

<br></br>

Earth knew who was behind it all. Humans. They were greedy and had lots of power at their fingertips. But the planets were pretty sure it would take a lot to cease their scheming.

<br></br>

Everyone knew they had to try.

<br></br>

So, one day, Earth bent down to talk to the humans. “Please,” cried Earth,” you are selfish and greedy. You can fix this but instead you are flying to planets and moons. Please, think about the planet. You are killing your future and soon there will be no hope.”

<br></br>

The people looked outraged at Earth’s outburst. Mystifying silence filled the air.

<br></br>

Then the people fell to their knees. Their faces were full of sorrow and they were in agony for what they had done. “Earth,” they cried" We are sorry for our damage and are now in anguish of realization.”

Earth’s face lit up and the planets beamed. “Do you promise," Earth said” To help save the planet?” The people looked up and said solemnly” We promise”.

When the humans had fixed their wrong, the Earth shimmered and sparkled in all its former glory with oceans cleaned of preposterous plastic, threatening factories closed, replaced with super solar energy shops and refurbished recycling plants with resourceful renewable machines.

Humans would never hurt the planet again, remembering the dreadful pain they had once experienced.
