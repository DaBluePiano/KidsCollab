Two Hearts of Two Worlds

<br></br>

Far, far away, in the deepest of the universes, there are two worlds. With the same orbit, the same sun, but a very different heart.

These two planets are Klopsifigest and Euroa.

They both had a goal. But they were both very different.

Klopsifigest wanted to save the planet and have a more environmentally friendly environment.  

Euroa wanted to have more jobs, have more buildings and be way more rich.  

The Klopsy, so immaculate

The environment, so crystal clear,  

The wind turbines generating

No sound could be more beautiful!

<br></br>

Euroa, so foul

The environment, so dismal

The coal miners thumping

No sound could be more calamicous.

<br></br>

In the northern plains of Klopsy

See the EV’s roll!

No harm at all

To the environment at all.

<br></br>

In the southern plains of Euroa,  

See the filthy cars go

No harm is just not true

The environment so destroyed, could not of been worse.

<br></br>

In residences of planet Klopsy,  

The waters are not wasted

For berries are picked for only when they’re eaten.

<br></br>

In residences of planet Euroa,

The waters are wasted
For berries are taken for granted.

<br></br>

In thickets of Klopsy,

The trees

The lush green in the forests,

Are animals’ heaven.

<br></br>

In thickets of Euroa

The trees are cut

The trees are cut, the brown in the forests

The animals’ graveyard.

<br></br>

In the institutes of Klopsy,

The computers are used

For no papers are wasted

All packaging is made from sustainable resources.

<br></br>

In institutes of Euroa,

The papers are used

For all trees are cut

All oddments are plastic and filthy foil.

<br></br>

In workplaces of Klopsy,

There are no papers at all,

<br></br>

Solar powered energy,

No damage at all.

<br></br>

In workplaces of Euroa,

There are papers everywhere

Oil powered nenergy,,

Damage in sight.

<br></br>

On farmlands of Klopsy,

No animals are in vain,

For no meat is used.

<br></br>

On farmlands of Euroa,

There are animals in vain,

For all of the food is hused, is meat.

<br></br>

The bad heart  in Euroa has left the world in doom.

The good heart in Klopst has left the world in joy
