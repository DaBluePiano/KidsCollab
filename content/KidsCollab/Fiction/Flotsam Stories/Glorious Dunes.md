Blue. Blue and repetitive. The only way to describe my old life. Back where the Organi ruled and we weren’t allowed to find anything out. And we knew nothing about ourselves. You wouldn’t have a family, more like a cluster. It was this way for every little Bacto. At least until the big dark shape appeared.

“Bactomam 6, you are assigned to the seahorses” Organi Regent’s rich voice cuts through the all voice bubbles. Our pods are lowered and since Regent doesn’t have the time (or the patience, says Bacto 46) to deal with us. I, as Bacto 26, extract the blood bubbles from the seahorses. The sensation of the air pockets float around and tickle, though I immediately hand them over. All Bactos in Bactomam 6, 16,26,36,46,56 and 66 have done their work. Nobody notices, of course. No one ever pays attention to the silly old Bactomams.

Every time I return to the pods I am struck by how my family is so different. Yes, we all have the same green tinge in our ruffled fur and those same almond shaped eyes, but doesn’t everyone? I have eyes flickered with opal, however, unlike their weathered obsidian eyes, and their matted, wiry hair contrasts so much to my static dark hair. But I never ask any of those questions. Apart from, maybe, why would I? ‘No questions’ say the Organi. And I never asked any. Until that shape.

It came in my fourth year of service, when we tamed wild seaweed. We were watching the weeds float freely away, catching bubbles when suddenly our eyes could not catch a glimpse of the as they were lost in the mass of this impossibly long line stretching through the pure water, made of a thick pointy substance. If you crossed Bactomam 6 at that exact moment, you would see our faces were something of a dumbstruck pufferfish. My friends knew not to ask questions. We all did. But I wanted to.

None of us in Bactomam 6 forgot that shape but it was only until a few months when that certain memory really took hold. Once again Organi Regent assigned us to the seahorses. But as we tended to them, they abruptly bucked us off wildly, and then with all of us sixes gaping with open mouths at each other and holding on just barely, the seahorses tore through the Shell Sanctuary, trashing thousands upon thousands of carefully crafted workmanships and breaking millions of budding artist’s hearts, we arrived into a Brobdingnagian clearing.

Jagged, cracked pieces. The same material as that shape. My Bactomam friends stepped back, aghast, at the same time I stepped forward. And I see a crumpled, stretched sheet. The seahorse that brought me looks – almost solemn, somehow. Like it knew what I was facing. And maybe it did. No one knew what seahorses did after being released. But as I reached tentatively to the sheet I had an idea. Which was confirmed when I read a single, shaky, word.

Humans.

It was like a vein had burst in my brain, but a vein of knowledge. Like a secret subconscious box in my head has had its lid ripped of with a giant powerful hand. Because memories and information were absolutely flooding my brain. In my physical form, I knew I was stumbling back from the overload. I didn’t know what humans were, but it was the password that unlocked a door in my min. I didn’t even know I had these memories, no record of it whatsoever prior to this.

The Organi had been keeping secrets from us.

The memories I never had made no doubt in my mind as I continued to be overwhelmed. I saw Organi performing torture and hiding it from us. I saw the same shapes millions of times. “Bacto 26!” Someone shouted, but my brain was on overload and the last thing I remembered was a flash of a newfound memory in which there were vibrant bright marbles stomped on by those humans. I was fixated on them. Then blackness overtook.

I woke up confined in steel. So, I assumed I was in my own familiar pod, until I saw the Organi Panel in all their glory and power, assembled and pacing and fidgeting in front of me. When they noticed I was awake, Organi Hale turned, and I saw his eerie orange eyes flash with anger as Organi Lanso’s shrew voice pricked my hair. “Bacto 26, you are now on asset 42, and exiled as you have found or secrets.” Not really listening, I focused on expelling energy into a secret I heard, and while Lanso rants, I shove the power and thrust it inside his head with a shrill shriek.  Although I wince at that sign of weakness, he gasps and slumps down, and I am free.

The secret I discovered in the brain overload was that each of the Bactomams were created as secret living biological weapon, ach equipped with a different power to serve their uses, should we ever have a war, and Bactomam 6’s ability was to control rigid molecules which I used to form a huge welt in Lanso’s head. But as I furiously work to detach the metal wires. Switches are flicked on and off and eventually the sleek lid slid open and I heard a satisfying fwoooooosh. I climbed up, and looked around for a sneaky hiding place but then froze dead on my feet, staring wildly to the water above. Because there was another shape.

Throat parched, lungs screaming, my arms scoop water as I rush to catch up with the shape – no a human ship. Relentlessly, I kicked, with Organi who were not incapitated, racing to stop me. However, I touched the material at the same time a hand grappled onto my leg. I thrashed about and focused on molecules but they were infused and nothing changed. Until I saw those marbles again.

I though of the tortured Bactos, the way the Organi had manipulated our entire live, and how they concealed all information. And I poured every single bitter thought into one attack and I bent its power so that the hand gripping my leg turned to a tail, and instead of fur, yellowish suckers decorated the bodies of the Organi Panel. I had turned the Organi into seahorses.

So, the dumbfounded seahorses drifted away with blank faces, and I dug my fingernails into the smooth ship. Like I would never part with it. Which all hanged when I saw land. Green lush curved things sprouted out of those amazing layered jagged rocks. Giants with spots and stripes, wearing different decorations. But the thing I most longed for was those yellow marbles. So, I waited and stared at the dark sky, who had put on a velvet blue skin that twinkled with lights. And then I embraced comatose peacefully and quietly.

As my eyes flickered open, I realized the ship was no longer moving, and I was fully awake and fully alert as soon as I registered the closest thing was those golden marbles glinting in the sun. I leapt off the ship and raced towards if when suddenly a thought struck me.

What of the Bactos under the sea? Now I knew their history, and I felt more connected to them. What could I do to make sure little Bactos didn’t have the same life as mine! Sure, I guess I got rid of the Organi, but they could rise again. So that’s when I decided to leave my legacy.

Channelling my thought the same way in that final showdown, I stared at those dunes and focused, focused hard. The more I glared, the more I noticed the marbles began to shift, more and more, until BACTO 26 was imprinted in the sand. I clutched my head and tumbled back, satisfied and tired. I needed a rest. But at least I had secured a new life for all generations to come, and defeated a great plot and tyranny.

So, my life in the terrible ocean was done, I had left my legacy. As I watched foamy white waves slam and give the marbles a doover, I laid back and realised my job was done. I would begin my new life on land, surrounded by this wonderful scenery and glen. And I have paved the way for others to have the same life too. All I have to do is wait. Wait, wait, wait.

60 years later
In a better world

I lie there, holding a marble to my chest. I’m surrounded by people. Team 6 who came in the only a few months after I left the message, the same way I came. And my family. After 5 years. But they got there in the end. Which is all that matters. I no longer care about how different we are.  My time is up, I know. As I bow my head for the last time, I recall my life. And now I know, know that those marbles of light were sand, and the sand was a beach, and a beach was land and water, and that sea and land made up our beautiful world that was part of a galaxy that was part of a universe I knew I could never fully comprehend. But I knew enough. So, I am relaxed as the hand clutching the yellow orb limp, and my eyelids seal opal eyes, and that static hair finally droops down in a sweet surrender to gravity after all these years, lying in the glorious dunes.
