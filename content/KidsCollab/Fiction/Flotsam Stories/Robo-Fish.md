Fizz! Bang! Pop! A ship has just come in pulling 10 tonnes of cargo and was going at a jaw dropping 100 nautical miles an hour! The ship has just toppled sideways letting all the cargo and goods into the ocean. But what they didn’t know about was that there were acid tanks too! What a disaster!

At first, it seemed like no one noticed it but a very quick marine life service boat has come! As soon as the guys on board the marine ship saw the wreck and they exclaimed, “Wow! This must have been a disaster!” They were the only ones that knew that there were endangered species underwater!

They punched in the marine life emergency number fast! They were in a great hurry. Soon enough, another boat came and it had a lot of equipment. They had a special acid drainer which was very useful. They drained all the acid in the water around that area for about 20 minutes and they discovered an extremely severe problem…

They had discovered the species of endangered fish had become more endangered! They remembered that there were more than 17 500 fish left, but now, there are only 200! They had to do something about it and they had to do it fast!

They rushed back to the shore and they planned how and what they would do it with. They had found a plan after just minutes of thinking! They planned to go to the ocean bed where the endangered species of fish lived and grab their eggs and multiply the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and simply put them back in! It seemed so easy, but was it the right way to go?

Soon enough, they had collected the eggs on the ocean bed and they had extracted the DNA and they had many, many eggs now! They were overjoyed! They had never realised they would become very dry and would not survive with no moisture. They walked to the edge of the ocean and before they dived in, the eggs had only been wrinkly, parched eggs in their hands. What would they have to do next?

They thought and thought. On and on. Hours and hours passed by. They came up with a very ingenious idea, to build something called Robo-fish. It is where they build a programmed fish. That’s what they did. Bob worked on the mechanics and Tim was working on the coding. It took a few months, longer than any other project they had ever done. But was the time worth the work?

The guys were very excited. They were joyous in fact! It had been 4 months since the acid spill on the water and things were cleaning up. There were only about 50 fish left now! The guys were so happy that they celebrated in the water. Little did they know, something bad was going to come.

They were happy and content the first day or two, but on the third day, Bob bumped a key in the code and made everything go wrong. They ran like a bolt of lightning to the shore before it was too late. The code had been deviated to EAT_FISH, they dived right in, and already, some fish were dying! This was all because they forgot to lock the code. They frantically searched for the Robo-fish and they ripped it out of the water and punched the emergency button to stop it. It was all peace and calm now. What would they do next?

They rushed back to the office and reworked the last part of the code to DON’T_EAT_FISH and locked it. They had also realised another problem. It was that the Robo-fish weren’t giving off any babies or eggs! They solved the problem by doing this: they extracted the DNA from the eggs (again), but this time, they remembered their mistakes and filled the fish with water and popped the multiplied eggs in and edited the code with an extra line to DISPENSE_EGGS_EVERY_FORTNIGHT.

They rushed to the shore, plopped the fish in and hoped for the best of luck. They came back to check every month to put more eggs in. In 1 year, the fish population has prospered quite substantially and the population soared over 10 000 000! They had a very big celebration party and they were all extremely content. There was something very unexpected coming up…

The year was 2052 and the two marine life services guys were retired and they had been nominated for the very prestigious Nobel Prize in chemistry. The two guys were waiting in the hall in Stockholm, Sweden very relaxed and happy. They had not even expected that they would be nominated

The service for the Nobel Prizes had started. Everyone was very patient and they listened intently for the announcer for the Prizes for physics, physiology and medicine and finally chemistry awards. There was a very long silence for the chemistry award and they finally announced Bob Travis and Tim Travis. The two brothers were very thrilled. They went up the stage and collected the shared Nobel Chemistry Prize and the crowd gave them a standing ovation for the brothers.

After getting home, the brothers’ award experience had still not sunk in. They were so happy. They couldn’t sleep that night that they hosted a party for them and boy was that party was good. It was a memory that stuck in their heads for the rest of their life. They had even remembered the amazing experience and all about it even when they were almost 80 years old!

The incident also raised public awareness about tankers and acid and also about fast boating on waters. The brothers made a campaign against carrying acid on ocean routes and only for air routes and also needing a licence for driving the boat. There should also be a speed limit. After they became deceased, the government enforced the rules for the things that the brothers had wanted.

There was never going to be any more acid spills in the ocean again, destroying the endangered species! Their legacy lived on and on.

Ten years later, the wildlife and marine services commemorated the time of 10 years since the big rescue of the endangered species of fish. They celebrated this achievement by making another Robo-fish for a species of fish that was very endangered and it boomed its population from 10 to 1 000 000. They did this every year from then on. Every year, one species of fish is saved. This is one of the greatest discoveries on saving the marine life in the oceans.
