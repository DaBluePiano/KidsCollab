All: Three . . . two . . . one . . . HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR!!!!!!!

Bunny: It’s the 45,000,000th anniversary since the legendary Jade race!

Snake: The one that decided who should own which lunar year!

Dog: I swear nobody knows who we are…

Rooster: Oh be quiet Dog, we have great stories!

Dog: I disagree…

Dragon: Why don’t we get any respect?

Snake: Well, let’s tell our stories and see what people think!

Dragon: Good idea! I’ll start!

Rooster: Let’s hear it, Dragon!

(Block slides in place as mountain)

(Dillon becomes cloud)

Dragon: See, I was the fastest animal on the starting line. I could fly! And the other animals were a joke! I mean, a rat? “Pffffffft”(noise made by dragon after speaking)

(Cloud Officer goes into place)

Dragon: But on the mountain, I met some trouble . . .

Cloud Officer; Stop right there!

Dragon; Wait, what?

Cloud Officer: You heard me! This is a toll office! Pay up!

Dragon: But I’m in a race, I’m about to make history!

Cloud Officer: History is no reason to avoid paying toll fees!

Dragon: Oh brother . . .

(Facepalm)

Dragon: but I got held up more by the bunny . . .

Bunny: Ooh! Now it’s my turn!

Dog: (quietly) HhMMmm! (angrily)

Rooster: Why? I think it’s quite good!

Dog: It’s just so dumb . . .

Bunny: I don’t think it is! Let me tell you!

(Christian becomes Villager)

Bunny: See, I’m a magical chinese rabbit. So I just bounced over the mountain.

(jumps over block)

Bunny: But the 2nd obstacle was the village, where I got a bit distracted . . .

(Villager jumps in front of Bunny, holding easter eggs basket)

Villager: Hey you! You’re a bunny! Can you deliver some Chocolate eggs for me, it’s Easter!

Bunny: I thought this was China . . .

Villager: Well, yeah, but the spread of Christianity! Look, I just need you to throw eggs as you run.

Bunny: Um . . . Ok! That sounds good to me!

(bunny takes basket, walk around throwing eggs)

(Villager exits. Turns into snake)

Bunny: And that’s when I met the dragon!

Dragon: See, I had just gotten past that pesky officer using tax evasion when I bumped into Bunny.

Bunny: Oh hi dragon! have an easter egg!

(bunny throws easter egg in dragons face)

Dragon: (rasping) I’m, I’m allergic to easter eggs!

(clutches stomach, fall down )

Bunny: Oopsie , well at least I’m beating the dragon in the race!

Dragon: W- W- Wh- Why me!!!

Bunny: And that’s how I beat the dragon in the race! I kept the Easter egg basket, though. Which led to a few more problems . . .

Snake: Hey, you calling me a problem? I prefer tactical genius!

Dog: How does he manage to hear us without ears . . .

Snake: Umm . . . Chinese magic, obviously! But my story is truly inspiring . . .

(Blanket goes on floor, becomes the river)

Snake: So, being magical and all, I just got through the mountains and the village easily. But when I reached the final obstacle, the river, I had a slight problem.

(Bunny reaches edge of river, still with basket)

Bunny: ha, snake, you can’t swim! I can just bounce over the river and win, even holding this basket!

Snake: Now, none of us knew that Tiger, Ox and Rat had already finished. Each of us thought we would be the first to win. And I had to win. So I took drastic measures . . .

(Snake walks alongside bunny as bunny jumps across river, pretends to be in basket)

Snake: I hid in the basket to cross the river. It was the perfect ploy! Except  . . .

(Dragon swoops down, knocks snake out of basket)

Bunny:(surprised) Oh! Snake! In my basket? I don’t think so!

(Knocks snake out into river)

(Bunny throws another egg in Dragon’s face, crosses finish line before him)

Dragon: Hey what! No fair!

(crosses line)

Snake: And so while Rabbit and Dragon came 4th and 5th respectively, I had to crawl my way up and came 6th.

Rabbit: Hey, actually, our places weren’t so bad!

Dragon: It could’ve been better if not for Easter eggs . . .

Snake: Well, at least we came in the top half! Unlike some people . . .

Dog: Be quiet please…

Rooster: Yeah snake!

Dragon: Hang on a sec . . . Rooster. What IS your story? I don’t remember it.

Rooster: Yeah, I know. Mainly because shortly after the race, China banned American fast food!

Rabbit: What has that got to do with anything?

Rooster: You’ll see . . .

Rooster: See, I entered the race on a technicality. The Chicken was supposed to race but I was up early and they mistook me for the Chicken. That led to a lot of trouble once I left the mountains behind.

(Dog becomes KFC dude)

KFC Guy: Hey Chicken! It’s me, KFC guy!

Rooster: Actually I’m-

KFC Guy: Hey, where’s your cape?

Rooster: What cape?

KFC Guy: You know, the one we paid you to wear, the one that has our logo on the back!

Rooster: I was meant to . . . sponsor you? Why would I do that?

KFC Guy: Because you’re a chicken, and we’re KFC!

Rooster: Um, I’m afraid that there’s been a mistake. I’m a rooster, not a-

KFC Guy: I knew it! You betrayed us for Red Rooster!

Rooster: Well, I mean, Red Rooster IS better, but  . . .

KFC Guy: Traitor!

(chases Rooster around)

Rooster:AHHHHh! (exits scene)

(re-enters scene)

Rooster: So, that’s why I didn’t come in the top half of the race. I got chased around by a KFC    guy.

(all in disbelief)

Dragon: Actually?

Rooster: Uh-huh!

Dog: Okay, I take it back Bunny. That is now the most ridiculous story I have ever heard.

Snake: Oh, be quiet Dog. You’re just grouchy because you came second last!

Dog: It wasn’t my fault! Here’s the story . . .

(dragon becomes pig)

Dog: You see, the thing you have to understand about dogs is that we are insanely loyal. But only to our master.

( pig falls, over sleeping)

Dog: The thing is, my master was the pig!

(Dog prods pig, to try to get it to wake up)

Dog: I had to keep waking my master up, and walking by its side to the
very end!

(pig falls over again, dog wakes up again. Repeat as they move through mountains)

Dog: Luckily, we were able to get past the village a little bit faster thanks to some chocolate eggs we found on the road!

(feed “egg” to pig)

Dog: I managed to feed the pig again thanks to some KFC left from some KFC guy  . . .

Dog: And eventually, I reached the end!

(crosses line, pig leaves scene to change back into dragon)

(all stare at dog in silence)

Snake: (slowly) your master was a  . . . Pig?

Dog: Yeah, and?

Dragon: Where is he now?

Dog: Sleeping, obviously!

Bunny: Okay, maybe you’re right, Dog. Our stories are a bit ridiculous. I mean, cloud traffic? Easter Eggs? Snakes that can’t swim? KFC? And a Dog whose master is a pig?

Dragon: Well, there’s a reason no one knows our stories, and that’s okay because . . .

Snake: Did someone say KFC?

(Holds up KFC bag)

All: WE DON’T CARE!!!!! WE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!

(exit scene)
