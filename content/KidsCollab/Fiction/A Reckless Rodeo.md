‘And the list of compulsory classes is as follows,’ the teacher said, ‘English, Maths, Science, History and Agriculture.’ Albert raised his hand silently amidst the announcement. 

‘Why do we have to do Agriculture in Year 7?’ he groans. 

He wasn’t especially a fan of animals, particularly livestock. ‘The government has made it in the curriculum this year,’ said Mr Book-lyn, our homeroom teacher and librarian.  It was the first day of School. Year 7. Books were piled on the shelves near the sinks, pencil cases were in the trays, and cork boards were hung on the walls. The students got out of their seats and headed to the shelves. They started writing names on their books. Maths, English, Science, History, etc. Albert wasn’t Australian. He was Thai. With this in mind, he knew that he would make a fool of himself. Especially in Agriculture. He hated cows.

Once the bell for the end of the day rang, Albert wandered over to Bus Bay. It started to rain, and as he stepped up onto the bus, he slipped over onto the ticket machine and somehow pressed the button to print tickets. Twelve tickets flew out instantly into the rain, and as they got hit by pinnacles of water, they instantly turned to mush. The driver was not impressed. Once Albert explained, he chose a seat towards the back and started reading the overview of the Year 7 English Unit. They had to write their own play of an event that had happened to them. The bus moved across West Dubbo quite quickly, but hit a brick wall when we arrived at the roadworks. It took the bus ten minutes to get across the obstacle course of everyday driving. When we finally crossed the bridge, Albert hopped off at the Darling Street stop, and walked over to the shop. Thai-no-mite: The Asian celebration store.

When he walked in,  Albert’s mum instantly saw the permission note for the Dubbo Show Cattle Team. Like lightning, it was signed, scanned and sent back to school. 

‘Nooooooooooooooo!’ Albert wailed. Never was this a team for him. He walked up to his room stomping as he went, then sat down at his desk. He was an only child, so only his friends were the other kids he met which meant that he had a lot of spare time. Albert liked his parents, but only to the point that they were looking after him, and not making him wear sandwich boards advertising Thai-no-mite on Macquarie Street during the weekend.

Next Monday, when Albert arrived on the bus, he noticed that nobody was in the playground. He checked his watch. 9:19am. 

Oh no!’ Albert thought. He started sprinting to the office. In one minute, he was in class, but was panting so hard that it kept on going for the next two hours. Once he stopped panting, it was Period 3 - Agriculture. Today, Mrs Wyong was teaching. She told everyone to get a rope. Once everyone had, she tried to teach how to make a lead rope. It took thirty minutes of untangling for just one student to get a  lead rope tied. Next, they met the cows. There were twenty cows and only ten students. 

So much for making friends,’ Albert murmured. Just before class ended, Mrs Wyong gave everyone their cows. Albert got two female beef cows, one most notably a Red Angus. Their names were Buttercup and Daisy. He thought these were terrible names as almost every cow in every book, movie and audiobook had cows named Buttercup or Daisy.

The next few weeks of school were not very exciting for Albert. English assignments, maths pop quizzes and history reports were due every day. Loaded up with homework, on the 19th of May, Albert knew that with the Dubbo show coming up, he needed to control his cows. They were not the most well behaved livestock, but not the worst. As his dad always quoted,
‘Trng klāng nidh̄ǹxy (just a little in the middle).’ 

When the show day came around, the Thai boy was up from bed at 5am. This was going to be the norm for the next three days. He had fried rice with stir-fried vegetables, not because it was Thai, but because it was one of the most non-Thai Thai foods.

‘Hey look,’ his dad  shouted from the other side of the kitchen, ‘I’ve got this brand new radio!’‘ABC Western Plains 95.9 FM. ♩♪♫♬♫♬♫♬♩♪♫♬♫’ 

‘ Why did you have to tune it to ABC? They have talk shows all night. If I want to listen to some of the songs, I have to wait until morning,’ complained Albert, ‘I mean-’ The school bus started rumbling past, so he grabbed his bag and dashed out the door. Only just did Albert catch the bus, but then he realised that it was the normal bus to Riverdale Shopping Centre. Once he explained to the driver when he asked where his ticket was, he was dropped off opposite the Caltex Petrol Station on Cobra Street. When the actual school bus came around, it was by far too late to make it to the school minibus that left in 5 minutes. He decided to run home and ask his dad to take him to the showgrounds. 

Once Albert had reached the showground, they were still setting up for the parade at noon. Thirteen minutes later, the minibus pulled up with the rest of the cattle show team. Although Albert didn’t catch the minibus, Mrs Wyong wasn’t too annoyed at him because he turned up at least. ‘Being here on time is the only thing that matters,’ she claimed. When the town bells in the distance rang nine times, the gates started to open and all the little children started pouring in with their parents. When the sun was high in the sky, a sense of what was about to come tingled in some people, but was so little that no one noticed. When the parade started, there was a policeman on a motorcycle at the front, followed by some unmarked cars, BMWs by the way, and there was us. The Macquarie Anglican Grammar School Cattle Show Team.

For some obscure reason, somebody decided to test out their trumpet when the bulls were passing. PPPFF! One of Albert’s bulls started stampeding, then the whole other herd of cattle started charging at the children. People started fleeing here and there. ‘Watch out!’ one of Albert’s classmates shouted, but it was too late. A bull ran over his right arm then-. Albert couldn’t feel anything.The next thing he knew was that he was in Dubbo Base Hospital.

The next day, Albert was covered from head to toe in medical toilet paper (bandages) lying on the lounge upstairs when the news started. ‘♩♩♪♩♩ ABC  News Western Plains, Good afternoon, I am Geoff Mann and this is the 12:00 bulletin. First up, thousands flee Dubbo Show after a man playing a trumpet started a stampede causing two injuries and minor scratches. The man has been charged with ‘causing injuries’ and is facing Court this afternoon. Next to the roadworks at the intersection of-’ He turned it off, just as his dad came rushing in with thirty-seven newspapers. They were the Sydney Morning Herald, so they were not cheap. ‘I bought the whole shop’s stock,’ as Albert’s father panted after running all the way from the Newsagent at 78 Wingewarra Street. I read the news snippet.

    'Thousands fled Dubbo Show yesterday as a man allegedly playing a trumpet caused a bull stampede that injured two people, a 13-year old boy and a 29-year old woman. It also left many hundreds of people unsure about ever going back to the show in 2022. We interviewed Mrs Wyong, an injured woman from the stampede and also a classroom teacher of the 13-year old.'#

‘Oh dear,’ Albert moaned. ‘Not only am I now famous, they've interviewed my teacher and she’s sure to give my name away. Now I’ll be teased all over the playground.’ His dad stepped in, ‘At least you won’t have to do Agriculture again for the rest of the year.’ Albert thought about it, ‘That’s a good point.’
