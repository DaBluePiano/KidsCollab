The dull tones of the classroom were getting to her. Grey streaks already ran through her hair, a result of mentoring those who could not see. She sat down on the plain wooden chair, rubbing her forehead - the government had not allocated any decor or art in the institute, as the users would not see them. It was the late hours of the school day, when her students were reading and improving their Braille skills. 

“Miss Nort?” It was Scarlett, the 8 year old girl who was blind from birth, who had been sent to the institute when she was 4. 

“Yes?”

“I was wondering . . .”, Scarlett’s voice was hesitant. “What is the colour grey?”

Miss Nort paused, her head turning in Scarlett’s direction.

“What do you mean?”

“I mean. . .”, Scarlett struggled to explain her question. “I mean - what does it feel like?”

The question strangely resonated inside Miss Nort, urging her to solve the problem,  imposed in a crypt in her mind, and she knew she had to find an answer.

It was a long journey from the Institute For Blind Youth to the city where Miss Nort resided. The train journey was lengthy, and she had time to ruminate on what was on her mind.The colour grey: It was a colour prominent in her life, and she felt it was monotonous, a colour droning out life. On the surface,she saw, it was a colour that was disliked, the symbol of endless existence extending out into infinite meaninglessness. But that wasn’t all. She felt that that answer was much deeper. And how to explain that to a person who had never seen anything before?

The city skyline was appearing in the window of the musty train. She had seen this many times before, the pointed shadows of the buildings rising over the people, encasing all smaller beings in darkness. To her the view was not one of consolation, of her arriving at home, but merely of the sight of her shelter appearing. She didn’t know where her real home was. She wondered why the institute was so different from the city. It looked the same. The same grey colours predominantly spread out across the landscape. But, she realised, it was the way they treated the grey that was different. The city accepted the grey, leaned on it like a constant that couldn’t be changed. They wanted to stay the same, to keep the same old grey. The Institute treated the grey like a barrier, something that limited their vision, the same ominous buzz preventing them from moving forward. The two views were different, she saw, but they had similarities. After all, there were visionaries in the city and people had accepted their fate in the Institute. They were not different worlds, perhaps, but opposing cities struggling to comprehend the bleak colour looming over their lives. 

But which city did she want to belong to?

For now, she was in a grey area.
