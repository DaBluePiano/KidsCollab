## SOMEONE HELP ME FINISH THIS

## Chapter 1
Ever since the beginning of time there have been particles. Many, many particles, suspended in space. Then they began moving in waves as they were pushed by an invisible hand. Some would pull together and make bigger particles, and some would slide past each other and create light.

They would come to form a tubular shape, rounded on the edges, giving off dim light like a jar of glitter. With gravity, the particles condensed and grouped together into clusters and then planets and stars. 6 The stars bore the shape of the tube, the baguette, and the planets were rounded and spherical. Some planets and the stars were made of magma at incredibly high temperatures.

Then the initial force formed rain; they fell onto the chosen planet by the initial unsuspending force. 9So the chosen planet was no longer of magma, but of rocks and soil.

And then there came the first plant. Its seeds spread over the land and continents, and there was for the first time green on the dark brown earth of the planet.

And then there came the first animal. It was large, thin, and had a tubular body, four legs, and a head on the front. The animal’s descendants spread over the land like the plants did.

And then came the first humans, who hunted animals, and picked berries from trees.They discovered fire, grouped together into many tribes, and some tribes made friends, some made enemies, some became friends, and some merged and some separated. Over time people were born and passed, but they were terribly inconvenienced. 

The baguette stars were inherently unstable, so they had to be collapsed into spheres like planets. The initial force did not allow that, and it was kept in its shape. Keeping it in its shape was an enduring task, so flares leaped and shot towards space. On the chosen planet the humans hid in caves, scared to go into an open area, in an effort to avoid flares from nearby stars. It set forests and plants on fire, and slowly everything was destroyed again.

For the second time, the particles were suspended in space again.

## Chapter 2
Time passed, and then eventually there came a second unsuspending force. This time though, it knew that it could not interfere anymore in such inconsequential ways. This time, all the ways the particles worked had to have a set rule, and all interferences made through subtle means. However long it had passed since the resuspension, the second, and final unsuspending force was undeniably wiser.

And so, the unsuspending force had impacted the world so that it formed the planets and the stars. They crashed into each other, disintegrating into countless debris, and they also revolved around other bodies that were bigger.  The stars could no longer be of the shape of the baguette; they were then spherical like the planets.

Then on a planet, Earth, rain fell from its newly created atmosphere. There was then once again soil, once again plants, once again animals, and once again humans. Life thrived on the planet, now not having to be in constant fear of the flares of the nearby stars. They could, in the day, admire the greatness of the sun, and in the night, be mesmerised at the constellations and light of the stars.

There were no humans yet, for that before them, there were the apes.

## Chapter 3
With the veil of the night sky closing upon the Earth, an ape observed something in the stars. It was a silhouette, rounded in the edges, and appeared to be tubular. The ape made noises for the other apes, pointing towards the baguette, its feet dancing rapidly. However the others took no notice of it, and fell back into a slumber.

The silhouette descended slowly as the ape approached, and they finally met in a piece of vegetation-less soil. What followed was a chaotic mess of noises; they clouded the ape’s mind; it was obviously shook, movement to a halt and eyes staring at the baguette. There was screeching, thumping, wheezing, and a manifold of other noises. The chaos of the noise settled, resulting in a stream of noise. Though the ape does not know the words coming from it, it has understood precisely what every thing it said meant.

The noises spoke: 
“This is the word of the baguette, the word of the unsuspending force.

“Do not fear me, for there is nothing to be afraid of. I come to you to sort out issues I have identified with the evolution on Earth: favouring shorter term gains. It is a dark pattern. I hope In this conversation you can be rewired in your thinking to see the long-term gains of the game

“The animals up until now operate by means of attack, and attack only. Your species, however, does not operate by such means. Be together, and do not sabotage each other even at times of desperation”

There was revolt from the ape.

“Sabotaging will only produce fear and distrust. As trust develops, so does power. Be kind to one another – it is the only way of survival.

“Currently, it is too dangerous to update all the brain-workings of apes. The interference would be too great. You have been selected as the ape the most adaptable. 

“As a test, you are to fast for five days, and give all your newfound food for your tribe. Do not eat even a crumb of anything. Do this, and you will be rewarded, and when the day comes, you will be revitalised into existence, and then you will tell everyone of the message.”

*The message of what?* The ape thought. *Why would I do this?*

The next instant the ape’s heart was grounded, though. It knew to follow the instructions of the baguette.

## Chapter 4
As the sun rose from behind a range of mountains, the ape awoke in a midst of confusion. Slowly, its senses came to it, and it sat in slight agony. It looked towards the open field where the baguette had been, but in its place was now a tree.

Growls came from its stomach. It was not good for the challenge that the baguette had set.

When the others woke and picked berries from the trees, the ape sat, looking at them, but not budging at the sight of it. When the others slowly devoured the flesh of their prey, the ape had nothing to do except to play with the bones of the prey.

*I must not succumb.*

However delicious the food in front of it looked, it always suppressed its impulses. This was not normal, it felt. And indeed it wasn’t – no animal had done this before.

## Chapter 5
On the night of the fifth day, as the ape was about to go to sleep, a strong thump sounded. It saw another silhouette against the sky, its rim lit a light blue by the moon. It was not a baguette this time. It was a predator.

The ape dashed forward at an extremely fast speed; it was one of the abilities that quadrupeds were good at. The predator, still vaguely undefined, was a quadruped as well, though. The ape had its back legs bent, and leaped up towards the cliffside. Its fingers clinged onto a depression in the rocks, and then came the loose pebbles falling down. It was now dangling on only half an inch of finger space, and the predator was right underneath it.

Its stomach growled with pain, stirring for any remaining pieces of food that had not been digested. The sensation of the empty stomach gave him a sharp pang. Its fingers are trembling on the depression, slowly climbing inwards after they slide down.

It looked up. The sight of the sky, the stars and the moon reminded him of the baguette, its descent from the sky, and the baguette was what had caused it to be so hungry. The baguette was what had caused this; without the baguette it would still have energy to battle the predator. The baguette is the enemy.

As a surge of fury took over it, it loosened its grip off the cliffside, mounting itself on the predator. Its fists bashed continuously at the skin, and lacerated it with a loose rock it picked up before falling. Out was the blood oozing down the predator’s body, and being absorbed by the ape’s fur. Its eyes were wide open with the iris focused solely on the back of the predator’s head. The attack was a thunderstorm on the predator’s back; it was uncontrollably fast. The baguette is the enemy.

Almost a possibility that had escaped the ape’s mind while its fury acted, the predator collapsed in a second. With its hand red, and stomach empty, the ape stared intently at the flesh of its now-turned prey. 

The baguette is the enemy, therefore I will succumb, the ape thought.

And it lowered its jaw, chewed on the flesh, and swallowed. It was satisfied.

## Chapter 6
The ape woke with a tingling sensation. There was, however, nothing there that would have caused it, upon inspection. Just before the ape was about to go back to sleep, it caught sight of a baguette standing upright on the open field, where it was last time, and the tree gone.

It approached the baguette with caution. The moon was directly overhead. 5 Then the voice of the baguette came again. 

“Ape. You have failed.

“For this you will receive punishment. You will contract a deadly disease that cannot be cured by any means.

“But you will not be left in complete desolation. Because some of your traits have proven useful, at the time of your death there will be a tribe of your offspring, made from thin air. They will act like your children, as if you had part in giving birth to them. They will bear a resemblance to you, and share your traits, although slightly different.

“They will be taller, to signify the new species. Though, they will still produce children and continue to change over the generations, since they are only the start of it.”

Over several years, the ape’s fur began to fall faster, its legs weakened, and its body not able to support it. Its tribe was in no mood to help him, and slowly, it reached the end of its years.

Merely standing took immense amounts of effort, and moving was even harder. It could not lift a limb without it hurting, and putting any amount of pressure on it was enough to make it scream.

Then it felt something had changed. Something external to the world, not outside of the world, but in a different dimension: the dimension of thought. Regardless, it did not know what to make of this yet.
