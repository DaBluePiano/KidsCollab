Trevor groaned. Yes, said the squeaky voice inside his head, of course your home was on the back of a tortoise. You should have expected it! Because it was true, his home, the sturdy little shed that had endured countless storms and hurricanes, was now on the back of a giant tortoise, steadily moving across the landscape. Trevor groaned again. He was not athletic, and as long as his house was on the tortoise, he had to be on there too. And your food! said the squeaky voice. Trevor winced. Thanks for reminding me. Quickly, he scrambled to the shops purchasing armfuls of junk food, vegetation, and an umbrella - life on a giant tortoise would be tough.

Janice couldn’t believe her eyes - Trevor Askor running and sweating like mad!? Wide eyed, she handed him the receipt and he promptly dashed out, muttering something about a giant tortoise house. Don’t be silly, her conscience chided, of course he didn - there’s a giant tortoise! And there was, a weathered, wrinkly old tortoise, towering over the desolate town. So, the next day, she booked herself for a psychiatrist appointment, only to discover the rest of the town had too.

Trevor had never done so much exercise in his life, as he grasped the leathery skin of the tortoise and pulled himself up. It was a gruelling, repetitive stretch, one you could never get used to. Luckily, a sugar rush pushed him on until he reached the shell, covered in the wet, dense moss that he used to call his backyard. As fast as his sugar low allowed, he ran (hobbled) to his house, and his new life.

Early the next year, scientists detected a new and strange island.
