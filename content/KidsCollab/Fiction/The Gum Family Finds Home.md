The Gum Family of four lives in a very unstable gum tree.

They felt very annoyed that the tree was unstable and very challenging to take it under control.

Therefore, they wanted a much safer place to live in.

So they drove a very large car to cruise around Australia to search for a place to call home.

They frantically drove to the amazing color changing Uluru, the friendly people in Kata Tjuta, the sheltered Kings Canyon, the unique Karlu Karlu, and the decorative Bungle Bungles

They also drove to the tropical Catherine, the volcanic Glass House Mountains, the stunning Three Sisters, the rock solid Cradle Mountain, the quiet Hasting Caves, the marvelous Twelve Apostles, the sunny Nullabor Plains, the costal Pinnacles and Finally, a strong home.

When they had finished searching all around Australia, they wanted to see they wanted to see their very best friend Kooka.

Eventually, they decided that they would drive back to their home.

They finally got to be back again with Kooka.

Because all of the places were not that strong and stable.

At home, the Gum Family put rocks and shelter for stability during very rainy and windy days.

They added a roof as a shelter.

Surprisingly, they bought two comfy sofas just for comfort in the OP shop for just $2!! HOW CHEAP IS THAT!?

They were very comfortable in their upgraded gum tree.

Now their house is absent from harsh conditions.

The End
