The voice over the loud speaker interrupted by nervous thoughts. ‘Ladies and gentlemen, this train terminates at Park Lane. It will be our last stop.’ I held on tightly as the train pulled up suddenly to the station. I looked at my watch – 2:34 am. Swinging my bag over my shoulder, I stood in front of the smooth double glass doors, waiting for them to open.

I stepped out cautiously, my eyes darting around already freaked on the fact that I had to walk down Park Lane to get to my house at the end. I walked slowly, trembling up the stairs to ground level and I saw those all-too-familiar shops that I had always walked past but only ever in the daytime.

My hands were sweating, gripping the bag. I darted around checking if there was anything lurking around me. I was extremely tired. It had been a long day at the hospital. I had a new time shift. It was hard to imagine doing this every day. Bang! I heard a trash can lid being knocked to the floor. I shrieked in horror and I bolted into the grocery store whose lights were still on.

There was a rustling of paper behind me. I was definitely sure no one was at the door. I heard breathing. Breathing around me, it was definitely not from the few customers that were shopping in the twilight. I took the courage to spin around and see who was there. I turned around and saw… No one. None. Just the door and the opposite shops. I was totally freaked.

I decided to shop for some groceries at the shop and I bought some bread. It was only $0.50. This store always was cheap. I walked calmly out the door and re started my trip. I was about to approach the so-called ‘bright’ zebra crossing when out the corner of my eyes, I saw a black eerie shadow behind the curtains of the bakery.

I walked very cautiously to the crossing and another sound got me and I fainted. Right on the zebra crossing. I ran the direction to my house and I knew that I would definitely be safe. I closed the door gently and as I was about the lock the window, I saw a disabled person on the zebra crossing, illuminated by the light hovering over the zebra crossing.

I was scared and shut the shutters and waited. I was going to sit on the couch and turn on the telly, then… the disable person appeared next to me and I screamed. The person started to attack me, but not with my surgical powers. (I mean I always carry some tool with me…)
