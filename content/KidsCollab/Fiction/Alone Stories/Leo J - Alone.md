The voice over the loud speaker interrupted my nervous thoughts. ‘Ladies and gentleman, this train terminates at Park Lane. It will be our last stop. I held on tightly as the train pulled up suddenly to the station. I look at my watch – 2:34 am. Swinging my bag over my shoulder, I stood in front of smooth double glass doors, glass door opens my, it makes my whole-body goose bumps.

In that street there is nobody which makes me way spookier than usual at night. ‘Step, step, step’ While I was walking I notice something was following me by making quiet sound. I noticed as breathes sound, it was not animal breathes. It was a human.

After I knew it was human, I freaked out and started to run, as fast as I can. ‘Bang!’  I tripped over on the rock and has blood on my knee but I couldn’t stop even though it was a big problem, I hate scary things. After few steps, I figured out I couldn’t walk anymore.

I was trying to call anyone who is in my phone call list but the problem was I had no phone battery because of watching YouTube. When I notice it out of battery I screamed in my mind. ‘Am I crazy? I swap my own YouTube with my heart attack. I keep tried my best to walk but keep failed. I had to just walk about 100 steps. When I started to make some hunting sound something moved again.

I freaked out again and moved as fast and move as fast as I can to ‘Korean Mart’. ‘Ding, Ding, Ding’ The door opened I gave the sign of helping and the notice I got hurt. The mart owner comes out with medicine chest I now have some relax time. Other customer shouted like a baby crying. I said ‘What happen’ and she said “It, it looks like: the best ketchup from ‘5G’s ketchup shop.’”

I felt if I could I will go into the mouse hole. It was not blood, ketchup, yes, the tomato sauce that we eat. I just fell over on the ketchup no blood. After I got Band-Aid and I walk slowly and go back home the time was 7am, time to go work.
