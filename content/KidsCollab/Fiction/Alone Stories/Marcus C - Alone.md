Alone 
By Marcus C
The Voice over the loud speaker interrupted my nervous thoughts. “Ladies and Gentlemen the train terminates in Park Lane, it will be our last stop.” I held on tightly as the train pushed up suddenly to the station. I looked at my watch – 2:34am. Swinging my bag over my shoulder. I stood in front of the smooth double doors waiting for it to open.
 
I knew going to the cinema was a bad idea, watching movies at 12 is not my cup of tea. I checked my phone again; my dad was meant to p ick me up at park lane and that was where I was. All I could see was a distant figure of what looked like to be a car.
 
The cat was at least 100 metres away from where I was were 4 dim lights glowing up the dark street, this way all the light I had. I started to walk along the damp and moist road. Leaves rustled behind me and rats squeaked. These noises frightened me. I decided to listen to some music. But all I heard was musical artist singing at being alone at night.
 
I was at the car now and I already noticing it was the big ford that belonged to my father but no one was in the driver’s seat. I started to feel a sick feeling in my stomach, what if my father left me. But I knew my dad, he would not be willing to leave his precious car without it be supervised. I decided to go search the deserted stores to see if my father was lurking in one of them. I started to look in the bakery because it was the brightest store which means I will not have to look for my father in the dark. The freshly baked bread enlightened me to have a small nibble since the last thing I ate was the butter popcorn at the cinema.
 
A shadowy figure appeared from behind me, this made me run away. Where was I going, I did not know but at least it was away from that creepy person behind me.
 
I franticly ran away from the person following me, that person seemed to be quite fast. I ran into the open door of the bakery and slammed the door shut. With all my might I pushed an empty cupboard to stop the stranger from getting in. Surprisingly the banging on the door stopped, did he give up. No, I heard a door open behind me and a cold hand was placed on my shoulder. I let out a terrified scream but when I turned around to see who it was. It was my dad. That will explain why Dad chased me around the lonely street.
 
After that event, me and my dad drove away in his beloved ford. And we were chatting away about football and stuff. And before you know it I was sleeping in my comfortable bed inside my warm house.
