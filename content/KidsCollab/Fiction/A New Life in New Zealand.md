A 440 word composition

1960s, New Zealand

Michael rose clumsily from his bed. He looked outside his window – the Dunedin landscape was blanketed with snow, a white canvas. He got out of bed, brushed his black hair, and got dressed for Uni. He crept silently downstairs. The Perkins were still asleep, as was their dachshund, who was slumped heavily on the couch, his whole body heaving as he snored. Michael spotted his lunchbox. That was part of the deal between the Asian students and the New Zealanders who offered their homes in exchange for weekly board. Michael frowned. Thinking of board had reminded him that he needed to get a job. But he could worry about that later. Uni first.

He shrugged his heavy bag over his shoulder, tightened his scarf and proceeded out onto his bike, where his friends were waiting. His friends were seated on their rusty bikes, waiting expectantly for Michael. “Bout’ time Michael”, joked one of his friends with his frustratingly easy accent. While they were riding to Uni, people called out to them in various Chinese phrases.  Michael and his friends ignored them. They were used to the racist assumptions the locals made. Their bikes whizzed past the barren trees dotting the side of the road, and their bodies shivered as the wind’s frozen claws scratched against their skin.

The students passed the Cadbury Factory, the amazing chocolate maker, where the heat from the cooking seemingly emanated from the building in a warm glow. Michael’s mouth almost defrosted as he imagined working, with all the heat from the ovens. By now the factory was long gone and closest to them was the library. The library was their sanctuary, where free heating was provided and where they could practice English phrases and do homework. “Here after Uni?” Michael called out. Only his friends could understand him. The Wool Mill was in front of them. There was currently an influx of male employees in the women-dominated industry, as the Labour Law in New Zealand meant women could only work up to 9pm. The Abattoir appeared on the horizon. New Zealand had a big livestock industry, and many jobs were available. Michael had noted down all the locations as potential job opportunities.

Finally, they arrived at the University where multiple locals were milling around. Michael headed towards to the University doors. He took one last look at the white snow that covered the ground – a fresh new page for whatever happened next. That was his world now, a new chapter in an old book, and he could do whatever he wanted to do with it.
