Looking through the crack in the old, wooden fence, the boy watched horrendously as the lava slowly edged towards his property on the edge of Napoli. Vesuvius had erupted once more. It had been going on for the past two days, with chaos erupting all over Italy.  So far, only a field of pigs had been destroyed, but the outskirts were the greatest risk.

Lava was bubbling on the 10 kilometre journey towards the big city. Napoli had a population of just over 2.5 million, and the experts reckoned 1.4 million of them were at risk. The boy’s house lay in a valley where lava travels on its way to the Mediterranean Sea. He edged his way into the run-down residence to pack his bags. ‘This, yes, that, no, and that, yess...’ he murmured hastily as he continuously packed his trunk for his way to London. His parents had owned the farm with pigs, and were not alive any more, but he had relatives in London who had moved away following the Nazi occupation in 1943.

Once the bags had been packed, an almighty boom followed. Ash, lightning and smoke were all present in the hazy sky of Napoli. ‘Rush, now, rush now,’ he said as he turned on his television set to look at the forecast. The newsman said that the flows of molten rock were due to reach the thriving city in just under an hour, and that they were moving at speeds of up to 9km/h.

The boy, aged only 12, had never driven a car before, but he knew his relatives would be sad to hear of his parents’ death, and even more so if he joined them. He searched the shed from top to bottom, only to find 5 litres of petrol. The juvenile poured the liquid in, loaded his trunk anticipating that it would start and whisked the keys from the shelf. The rumble of the engine started nicely, but was dwarfed by a series of explosions.

He saw a flaming rock headed for the roof, but remembered he had forgotten his pocket money of £12.54. He rushed inside just as the rock smashed the roof. Fires started in the laundry, and moved to the kitchen where, with cooking oil, had infuriated the blaze. Just as he grabbed the jar, it slipped and crashed into the floor, shattering into a million pieces. Breathing heavily, he only scraped up £10.57 and left, leaving the other £1.97 to burn, char and melt.

Once in the car, he jammed the accelerator and zoomed off, only to find the lava biting at the congested road. He decided to take the bypass, and was stopped at a toll booth. ‘Ciao,’ said the man. He was kind and realised that the boy was poor.’I only have £10.57 and I need £10 for the ship. £0.50 will buy me a meal to eat.’ ‘7 pence please, actually, nothing.’ ‘Thank you, I’ll send you a gift when I get to London. ‘Here’s my address, it’s on an island off the coast.’

The boy went on his way to the port, which was jammed with ships. The ship was just about to leave when he raced to the ticket office. Lava was trailing behind him. ‘Here’s £10, can I go with my trunk?’ ‘Yes,’ said the ticket lady. He raced up the gangway carrying the trunk behind. PUH-PUH-PUH! The ship left for a nation that prospers, and a nation that cares. Off it sailed to the horizon and beyond.
