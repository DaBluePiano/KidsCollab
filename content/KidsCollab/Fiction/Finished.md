The woods shifts, shadows crawling, crawling, moving, almost alive.

A spot of white, the lonely traveller in the gloomy night.

Or is he?

Peter Rabbit hobbles on the forest path, glancing from side to side.

A splash of orange, darting from his side.

Peter looks around fearfully, crouching, getting ready to run, when - 

“Hello, Peter.”

Mr. Todd leaps, tackling Peter to the ground.

“I finally have you,” Mr. Todd snarls into his ear, teeth dripping wet with saliva. “After all this time.”

Peter starts to smile. “Well, old friend, I didn’t expect to run into you tonight. Listen, my family is waiting.”

Mr. Todd’s single eye gleams in the moonlight, obsidian shards of glass. “Old friend? Well you certainly are old to be caught like this.”

Peter tenses in the grip of the fox’s claws. “Todd, I understand you hate me. I know you blame me for your eye. But I really need to go.”

The fox clenches his other fist. “Peter,” he spits out the word with absolute contempt. “Peter. Do you know what I want the most?”

Peter glances at Todd’s face. The beginnings of a mischievous smile begin to sprout on Peter’s face.

“Blink?”

“No!”

“Get cross eyed?”

“No!”

“Give someone a side eye while looking at something else?”

“Stop making eye jokes!”

“Well, the way I see it, EYE-ther you let me go or EYE keep making jokes.”

Mr. Todd slams Peter’s face into the ground, creating a cloud of dust on the forest floor.

Peter turns over to face Mr. Todd’s malicious snarl.

“No,” Mr. Todd says emphatically. “The one thing I want is to taste rabbit again.”

Peter scrambles up and makes a run for it. “Well, I think you’ve missed your chance.”

Mr. Todd malevolently smiles, white teeth glinting, but now you can see the red stained on his teeth.

“You misunderstand, Peter.”

Peter stops at the edge of the clearing and looks back on one foot. And finally, finally, Mr. Todd can see, can smell, the fear in his eyes.

“You see, I already had a wonderful dinner.” Mr. Todd walks towards Peter, his footsteps echoing in the clearing. “I just came to tell you.”

Peter is frozen, unable to move, as the fox draws nearer and nearer.

Then he speaks one word, a delicious word, a word that Todd will savour for the rest of his life.

“Please.”

Mr. Todd's smile widens, growing, for he knows what Peter is begging for, what he is asking.

Peter curls deeper into himself, trembling with anticipation of guilt.

Mr Todd draws out a small rabbit skin, the colour of Peter’s little sister.

Confirmation.

And Peter cries out, in agony, and he speaks that word again.

“Please!”

But this time it has another meaning.

Mr Todd knows.

Peter is asking him to finish him.

Mr Todd finally reaches Peter and stands over him, knowing he has finally surpassed his nemesis, knowing he has broken him finally, and oh it tastes so good, and he licks his lips.

“Peter, Peter, Peter.” Mr Todd finally speaks again. “Your fear tastes so good.”

Peter is no longer shrunk into himself but is now standing, tears glistening on his cheeks, daring Todd to do it.

Todd looks at the little creature, and knows that if he has any shred of mercy in his body he would kill it to end its grief, put a stop to its pain.

But does he want to do it?

“Todd, do it quick.” Peter is confident, confident that the fox will do the job.

The shadows deepen around the pair, the fox towering over the rabbit and silence settles over them.

They have nothing to say to each other, finally.

Todd reaches a decision.

A single lonely traveller in the night.

He knows he is alone.
