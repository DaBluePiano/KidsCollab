The ground looked nice today.

Sure, it had a few nicks and smatterings of bird poop, but all in all, the ground was in good condition. At least better than how it was yesterday. And besides, even if the ground was destroyed, uprooted, it was better to look at the ground’s scars than to feel the daggers pointed at his back from other students. And even though the ground was monotonous, so were the whispers floating through the corridor, darting past his unsuspecting ear. ‘Is he really . .?’ ‘He looks so wrong’ ‘Why does he look like that?’ They didn’t really have the time to think up new material, anyway. Why would you spend time thinking about Gavin?

One time, in English, sitting at the back alone, he heard glimpses of quotes from his teacher. ‘One must imagine Sisyphus happy.’ It was a quote from the philosopher Albert Camus, and for once he could do something no one else could. He imagined being Sisyphus, eternally condemned to pushing a rock up a hill, never completing a task and he thought. Not of the pain, not of the work, but of the freedom. And not freedom to do anything but freedom to be away, away from everyone else. It was, to him, a distant view of happiness. And he wouldn’t mind the pain either. He had plenty of that in real life anyway. He could feel the purple colouring shifting under his skin, tucked away behind in his shirt and the lumpy scabs on his arm untidily hidden by his white sleeves. The scabs never lasted for long. They tended to always hit the same spot.

As he made his way back home, the wind blew even harsher on him as he heard the chattering of kids laughing with each other, the whistling of the wind his companion. It was always hard on the way back home, and it was even worse when it rained. All the other students took the bus, but you had to have a special pass from your parents to catch the bus and  why would his parents give a bus pass to him? Why would they even notice him? No, in the rain he walked back home, the weather bemoaning his fate.

But today he was not alone. Today kids streamed out of the school gates beginning a long trek to their households. Today, the weather smiled like it was taunting him, like it had joined his oppressors, like even nature had turned against him. Today, he felt the tugging on his backpack like he always did. The rough hands of the boy everyone knew for one reason or the other pulled on the holder of his meagre possessions and threw them onto the road. Then, he reversed his direction and pushed into Gavin.

The ground came closer in to embrace him. His only friend.
