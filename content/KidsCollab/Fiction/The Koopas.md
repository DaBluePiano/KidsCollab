The Koopa’s are Bowser’s family,and they work together to fight Mario.
Unfortunately,they have not been able to defeat him yet. Mario is too powerful!

The Koopa’s have one shell each to provide safety and to attack.
These attacks are called shell spins,and they are very powerful.
What makes shell spins powerful is that all Koopa’s have spikes
on their shells! That is, all except one. Lemmy.Instead of spikes,
Lemmy has bumps on his shell.

They also stole wands to petrify Mario/crew.That means that they can
turn Mario/crew into stone. Yikes!

The Koopalings are also known for being the bosses of Super Mario
Bros.U Deluxe.

Lemmy uses stone spells and shell spins. Morton prefers hitting giant pokeys with his hammer to send them flying towards Mario. Wendy likes
to skate on ice while sending spells from her wand. Larry uses the same as
Lemmy. Iggy is super-fast and summons lava/lava monsters. Roy blasts
Bullet Bills from his Bill blaster. Ludwig has his very own powers and his wand. Lastly, Bowser breathes fireballs.
