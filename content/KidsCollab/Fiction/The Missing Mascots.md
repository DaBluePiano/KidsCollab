Man, I hate virtual reality holograms. That is my first thought when I see several zoo animals wandering in our school. 2 roars,  2 snorts, and a growl echoes in my ears. A purring lioness, a brobdingnagian hippo, a fully tusked elephant - even a spotted cheetah prowls our school - how can it be real? But no, the animals are flesh and blood, and not some kind of stimulus cooked up by our teachers.Wait . . . no, I’m sure it cannot be. You see, our mascot, Emu Blue, roused up all of these equally bored mascots into our school.

First, let me explain what Emu Blue does as a mascot. Emu Blue monitors all assemblies, looking for a really good class to take care of him after. He also oversees the award system, because his face is printed on elaborate Emu Blue, hence the name. He looks like a bushy emu with a streak of blue caressing his neck. However, as the whole of lockdown started, there is an absence of assemblies. Missing too, are Emu Blues in circulation, meaning Emu is completely relieved of his duties and has nothing to do but stand solitary, catching dust. Basically, it meant all he could smell the stench of his feet, all he could taste was his tongue caked in dust, all he could see was the lonely and empty void that was once called the administration office and all he could was absolute silence. It was as frustrating as teaching a penguin how to fly.

Luckily, Emu Blue was not the only one thinking the roof was the sky, because the whole of the local Council was also in lockdown. So thoughtful Mr Blue sent telepathic envoys all the way to Toon, Ridge, and pretty much every other school in the area apart from our nemesis, the absolute cheater and killer Gilbert. The mascots ( hippo, lioness, elephant,cheetah, giraffe and gorilla) arrived very punctually and came in various methods, such as the hairy gorilla gripping the  smooth precarious electrical cables and swinging ; the giraffe simply leaning her astoundingly long neck to our school and the cheetah zooming uncomprehendingly fast. Despite this smooth arrival, their unplanned visits caused several uncomfortable problems.

While the animals got to the right school, they didn’t go to the right place. This is where they ended up:
The giraffe leaned too far forward and got tangled up in the newcomball net.
The gorilla leapt too far and entered the school with a massive concussion so broke a costly interactive whiteboard.
The cheetah became sidetracked running around the oval, then attempted to free the giraffe but instead got stuck in the cricket nets.
The hippo could not find an entrance he could fit in, so he busted through the once hydrant pump and turned it into a pool for mascot hippos.
The lioness accidentally ate Emu Blue’s little brother, Emu Clue, and was trialed in a fully fledged court case.
And the elephant trashed our beautiful and new L block and left Con’s shed screaming in pain


Emu was horrified by this dastardly outcome and waddled at an alarming speed towards all the trouble. However, once he had freed the tangled giraffe, the dazed gorilla, the cheetah that had square spots, the clumsy hippo, the murderous lioness and the destructive elephant they were too big to get out of the school. So the other schools’ mascots have gone missing, and Excel School had an extra six. So I think it’s fair to say, being stuck inside brings out the worst of you.
