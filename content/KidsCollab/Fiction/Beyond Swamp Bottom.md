Slowly pressing the brake, I ground to a halt and stopped at the dilapidated Swamp Bottom station. The platform was lit by a single lantern, casting a dim light on the moss-covered sign. The girl, the small hamster, even tinier bird and that black monster thing of hers alighted the train, bowing to me as they left. This left the train deserted, just the wooden handles that swayed side to side, and the mahogany seats were left empty.

Ahead I saw the dark, forbidding forest. The unknown lay beyond Swamp Bottom. I remembered the old kotowaza: A frog in a well does not know the great ocean. The only way to get a complete view of the world was to explore it. Only a small passage led the track through the twists and tangles. Every turn, every shadow looked as if it had some sort of monster behind it, ready to leap out and grab me, and take me into the unknown.

Edging ever slower through the twisting track that was before me, I saw a log on the track ahead, denying access to beyond. The train brakes squeaked as I slowed down to have a look. I opened the door, my boots crunching on the ballast underfoot. I reached out to shine a light on it, but my head felt like it had exploded and everything went black.

I opened my weary eyes, wondering why I was so tired. I tried to get my hands to clear them, but I looked and saw my hands bound with rope, and the blurry light of a fire illuminating a rundown pagoda. I remembered the tales of my father about the spirits that lived in this forest, the supposed Oni, spirits of calamity and misfortune. I never wanted to meet them. I definitely never wanted to be captured by them.

Their leader, with three eyes, sharp talons and glinting horns motioned towards me. At his command, his henchmen came and lifted me up to come into the pagoda. Their ‘ride’ was full of bumps and jolts, scrapes and scratches. While the warm fire was definitely a stark contrast to the last few hours in a cold and damp forest, they placed me so my skin was scorched and covered in sweat. Flames licked at my feet, under my wooden stand over the fire. As a small section collapsed, sparks erupted in a bright flash.

The leader approached me with a mischievous grin. ‘Every year the railway has had to make sacrifices to the Oni to protect their precious track.’

I shuddered as I struggled to comprehend it. I was going to be the sacrifice.

Oni watched me for a few seconds. ‘This hourglass represents the flames. When the sand is gone, you will be too.’

I watched painfully as the sand slowly tricked out of the bulb. Every grain was one less chance of being safe. One less chance of seeing my family again. One less chance of being alive.

The trickling sand taking my full attention, I didn’t hear the faint rustling in the trees behind me. Nor did the Oni. It slowly got louder, easing its way into my consciousness. I turned my head slowly, looking to see where it had come from. A hand poked out of the bushes, followed by another. I gasped in astonishment.

My father! However, the Oni saw him too.

Full of horror, I could only watch as talons raised to strike, the Oni came after him. Father had no chance. I watched as he got bound with rope, bound so tightly that there was no chance he could escape.

He got lifted onto the same platform as me.

‘Son,’ he croaked. He was covered in scratches and scrapes. ‘I’ve travelled for hours trying to find you, but I’ll soon lose you.’ He took a breath. ‘But you will go free.’ He gathered the last of his strength, facing his captors. ‘Let the boy go. I will be the sacrifice.’

‘No!’ I screamed, thrashing at my bonds. Father faced me. ‘It’s the only way. I want your mother to have some hope. Something to look after.’

The Oni faced us. ‘Very well, the boy may go. But he never comes back again.’ Something in that look made it feel so very real.

‘One last thing my son.’ He handed me a small wooden bird, beautifully carved. ‘Take this Ofuda, they say it brings good luck.’ He smiled, with a weary look on his face. Sadly, those were his last words as I trudged out of the pagoda, breaking into a run as I left the clearing, heading for the train, never to come back again.

All these years later, I still remember my father’s sacrifice. A plaque now lies in the train, honouring his sacrifice so we could carry on. No-one has gone into the Oni Forest since. The unknown still lies beyond Swamp Bottom.
