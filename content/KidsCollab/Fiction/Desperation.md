“Next!’

He shuffles forward, his army cap drawn low over his face, hiding his eyes. He briefly tilts his head towards the registrar and when he speaks his voice the scraping of rocks on the road.

‘I’m looking for Grace. Grace Taylor.’

His calloused fingers tap against the dark scar in his hip, feeling for the skin that didn’t exist anymore, the blisters in his right hand he got from loading creating sparks on his skin, as he waits for the registrar to search her up. His army boots smudge brown against the white floor, and suddenly he is reminded of a hospital. No. Not again. It had followed him again. The hospital, where he had last seen Charlie, where he lay immobilised for days after the bomb, not knowing what had happened to his best friend, where on the same colour floor of this building he was told the horrible news, where the nightmares started, the nightmare he knew would never go away, that would never go away because it was the truth, that it was him, him who had killed his friend, him who had lost his entire regiment, him who caused himself to be the only survivor, surviving only to feel that echoing pain every day, him who -

“Sir?”

It was the registrar who dragged him out of the spiral with him with his blank stare and flat, bored tone which somehow softened as he continued.

“Sir, I’m sorry. Grace Taylor was killed in a fire on 14th February, 1942.”

No. No.

The registrar barely had time to look up before he saw the soldier lunge at him, grabbing at him,  looking at him, and he gasped when he saw the man’s eyes, those eyes black as night, those eyes that radiated complete and utter desperation. They were the eyes of a crazed man, who had kept his broken pieces together for so long, for too long,  who had finally felt his soul snap, felt he had nothing to live for, and it was this brokenness that made the man so dangerous.

No. No. No.

There was no life in the man’s - the animal’s eyes - just pure desperation, desperation for anything, for, for it to be a lie, for the war to be a lie, for and end to the war in his soul, for his soul to just die, just die like his sister, like his friend, his friend who he’d killed, he’d killed all of them, but no, no, no, they’re not dead, they’re alive. And all he’d have to do was drag himself out of this place and he’d see them, smiling. And there was no bomb, and, and, 14th February was only the day Grace had slightly burned herself, cooking, as she waited for him to return and now he had. He staggered his way out of the building.

The registrar had seen this happen far too many times.

“Next!”
