Scene: (A paintball field. 5 friends are getting for a 2v2 while one is refereeing.)

Jack: Alright everyone, gather around! We’re about to start the paintball match. Xander, Terry, Nikhil and Ivan listen up!

Xander: (annoyed) I still can't believe I got dragged into this.

Terry: (aggressively) Let's do this! We’re gonna win!

Nikhil: (focused) Remember, teamwork and strategy are crucial. We need to coordinate our moves.

Ivan (confused) Umm guys I don't even know how to hold this gun 

Jack: (smiling) Don't worry Ivan I'll explain the rules. Each team is trying to aim for the opponent, and that's all I know, sorry guys…

Ivan: Are you kidding me

(scene: The match begins. The players take cover behind various obstacles)

Jack: Get into your positions! Ok, BEGIN!

Xander: (whispering to Terry) Can we just hide here and avoid getting shot?

Terry: (frustrated) No, We came here to play, not hide like a bunch of 5-year-olds!

Nikhil: (pointing to the field) Ivan, take the left flank while I advance from the right. 

Ivan: (reluctantly) Fine but make it quick

(scene: Terry charges forwards firing rapidly. Xander provides cover fire.)

Terry: (yelling) Take that! And that! I'm invincible HAHAHAHA

Jack: Oooo, what is going on??!?!?

Terry: Shoot me if you can! Oh wait, you can’t, you’ve already been hit.

Xander: (whispering to himself) I've never seen Terry this intense before. I don't know if I want to do this anymore…

Terry: TAKE THAT AGAIN!

Nikhil: (focusing) Keep calm Ivan we need to work together. Ivan? (Ivan is gone)

(scene: Ivan wanders around and doesn't know what to do)

Ivan: (confused) Um guys where do I go? What do I do?

Nikhil: (yelling from a distance) Oh there you are! Ivan just follow your instinct and don't die.

Ivan: (nervously) Okay I'll try

(scene: Ivan and Nikhil move forward cautiously, while Terry continues to go rampage tryhard mode.)

Terry: MUAHHAHSHHDAHHSAHAHHS (loud)

Jack: Terry please calm down my ears hurt…

Nikhil: (nods) We need to watch our backs. Terry’s going berserk out there. Let's flank them from both sides.

Ivan: Wait, what about Xander?

(scene: Terry is out.)

Terry: AH! NO, STOP CHEATING!

Jack: Terry is OUT!

Xander: (surprised) Geez I didn't expect Terry to go down so soon.

Terry: (furious from a distance) That was a lucky shot I DEMAND A REMATCH AH

(Scene: Ivan and Nikhil continue to engage the enemy. Using their teamwork and strategy. Also, Ivan gets out)

Nikhil (calling out to Ivan) Ivan, take cover behind the barrels! Wait for the perfect moment to strike!
 
Ivan: (tripping over his own feet) Oops I accidentally shot myself

Jack: Okay Ivan that doesn’t count, just keep going

Ivan: I still don't know what I'm doing! Wait why is that bullet getting bigger and bigger? OW

Jack: IVAN IS OUT!

(Scene: The Walk of Shame; Xander doesn't want to play anymore)

Xander: (muttering) Great.

Nikhil: (Was about to shoot, but notices that he's sad) Xander, what's wrong?

Xander: I don't know, I didn't expect to be doing this today…

Nikhil: What do you mean?

Xander: I… don't like paintball

Nikhil: What could be wrong with paintball?

Xander: It just seems like a waste of time, you know? I could be doing homework, or watching TV, or-

Nikhil: So are you saying you quit

Xander: Uhhhhh yea.

Nikhil: YAY! I WIN!

Ivan: (From the sidelines) You mean WE win?

Nikhil: Yea ok

Terry: (From the sidelines) Wait can someone repeat that I wasn't listening 

(scene - character - referee) 

Jack: Full Time! Wait, who won I didn't hear either.

Terry: What do you mean how do you not know who won how bad of a ref are you? I could do so much better than you what are you even doing in your life?

Jack: Guys, I have a confession to make. I don’t know what a paintball is…

Ivan: What, what do you mean? Do you mean that all this time… really?

Xander: (half at Nikhil) You mean that I was dragged out here for nothing?? WHY. I COULD BE DOING ANYTHING ELSE IsI ACTUALLY ENJOY RIGHT NOW. SERIOUSLY.

Jack: Look do you think I also want to be here? 

Terry: Yes. Paintball is awesome! Also who won?

Nikhil: Why didn't you tell us earlier?

Terry: (interrupting) Who won?

Jack: I was going to until I forgot

Nikhil: How did you forget?

Jack: I was thinking about the things I enjoy. You know, like…. Uh…other stuffNikhil: Then why didn’t you tell us you wanted to do something else insteadTerry: ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!!!!! WHO WON the competition???Xander: They did.

Terry: OH COME ON! (walking up to Ivan, Xander and Nikhil) Hey guys, ready for another round?

Xander: Yeah, no thanks I'm good

Jack: Yeah, me neither, plus you won't have a ref anymore remember? 

Terry: Oh yeah

Xander: Wanna go play soccer or something

Nikhil: Actually, that does sound good

Terry: I like soccer
