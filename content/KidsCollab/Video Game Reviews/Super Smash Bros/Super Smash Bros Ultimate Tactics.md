Here are some of the best characters to play in Super Smash Bros, ranked in terms of power and easiness.

10. Fox/Wolf

A great starting character, Fox and its echo Wolf are strong fighters with a long-range attack. it is versatile in many different stages due to varied attacks. However Fox does not deliver as much damage output as other fighters, but the ability to continually attack earns it a spot on this list,

9. Samus

Samus, hailing from Metroid, is another long-range fighter but it also has an ability so powerful it is an item. The screw attack, which turns jumps into a deadly weapon is a highly utilised move, as dodging once in the jump is impossible. Samus also does not have high damage output in its attacks but is able to beat out Fox due to the fact that it can land attacks more ably.

8. Pokemon Trainer

Pokemon Trainer is possibly the most versatile fighter in the game due to the ability to literally switch fighters. It has high damage and is able to land attack after attack as Ivysaur. The true powerhouse of the team may be Ivysaur, especially when in flat stages where falling off is impossible, such as Wii Fit Studio. A problem with this fighter, however, is that it cannot jump and recover as well as other fighters
  
7. Ken/Ryu

An iconic duo, these two are the loudest on the field, with shouts of HADUKEN blasting out of the Switch. They have well-rounded attacks and are hard to both dodge and launch. Their recovery is also reliable and, to top it all off, their attacks just look plain cool.

6. Lucario

A fan-favourite Pokemon, Nintendo has delivered with this fighter's awesome offensive and defensive attacks. With its normal Special, it can guard its back while charging up a powerful Aura Sphere that it can release whenever it wants. Lucario's Final Smash sacrifices high damage for an adjustable aim, ensuring a hit on the opponent.

5. Cloud

Cloud has a very high damage output, able to trap opponents in cycles using moves that look absolutely amazing with his sword. It has high speed and but it takes a lot of damage as its defence could definitely be better.  

4. Villager

Villager is a highly recommended character, with high attack and excellent speed. It can jump high and has the handy ability to be able to pick up and store items for later. One major drawback to this fighter is that it needs lots of skill to utilise it to its full potential. It's way too OP for a fighter from Animal Crossing.

 3. Bowser

Bowser is both literally and figuratively a beast. It has easy controls and has game-changing attacks with a single swipe. It has a great ability to strike the opponent over and over again without chance of retaliation, and his Final Smash is aimed. One thing that limits Bowser's abilities is that it is slow and cannot jump well.

2. Meta Knight

Meta Knight has ridiculous attack output. His Drill Rush attack does up to 15% damage when used properly and has a major launching ability. Like all Kirby characters, Meta Knight can also jump multiple times, not to mention an offensive-up special. It is fast and has an infinite sword attack for its normal, allowing it to push back enemies. Meta Knight also has a good Final Smash, dealing lots of damage and launch. However, Meta Knight is prone to falling off and can sometimes be uncontrollable.

1. Kirby

Kirby is versatile, with multiple attacks that balance defence and offence. It is also a starter in story mode and the game itself, able to survive and deal lots of damage. It has high jump ability, paired with a ridiculous down special that renders it invincible for several seconds. Kirby is a mainstay in competitive Super Smash Bros.
