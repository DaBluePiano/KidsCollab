**Dillon**: (slowly) When the European explorers of the 1400s set out to conquer various parts of the world, they did so with three motives in mind:

God

gold

And glory.

They sought treasure, whether it be material, like gold or spices, which would then help them fund armies to reclaim Jerusalem in God’s name. There was also a civilising mission that propelled them to go forth. Rudyard Kipling called this “the white man’s burden”. Essentially they wanted to convert native people to Christianity. For explorers, there was always the lure of personal gain and glory, the glory of having discovered a new land and maybe even having it named after you.

These "treasure hunters" have all become famous due to their quests, but the real question is, what is the true treasure? Is it spiritual, material or is it fame? What makes someone the most … fulfilled? What makes life worth living?

Well, you can google it or something. I have a high school reunion to get to.

**Xander**: *walks on, very businesslike* Evening! Is Atharva here yet?

**Dillon**: Nope.

Atharva drives up (Xander and Dillon are either tapping their foot on the ground and checking their watch or pacing up and down the curb)

**Atharva**: Hey guys, sorry I’m late. I got held up at the studio. The director wanted to talk to me about my latest game show "Million-dollar Quiz".

**Dillon**: Bless your heart, thanks for driving us.

**Xander**: Honestly Atharva, with all your fame, surely you can afford something better than this piece of junk.

**Atharva**: Gee, thanks, Mr CEO. Real nice of you.

Xander rides shotgun(will show better interactions)

Atharva starts driving (turning hands-on ‘steering wheel’)

**Dillon**: Come on guys, just turn the other cheek. Xander, If you want us to have better cars, maybe you can be charitable and buy us some Ferraris.  

**Atharva**: Wow, you’ve changed, Dillon. Maybe, you could come on the quiz show I'm working on, it's a trivia show, and you get to pick the topic you are an expert at. So you can have the bible as your expert area.

**Dillon**: Thanks but no thanks.

**Atharva**: Suit yourself.

**Xander**: Speaking of suits, where are yours? This is the 20-year high school reunion, you know.

**Dillon**: Not everyone can afford a fancy Armani suit like yours, Xander.

**Xander**: Well Atharva doesn’t have one on at all! Is he going to a high school reunion or McDonald's?

**Atharva**: So what? I’m not rich like you. Are you going to a high school reunion or a date?

**Dillon**: Guys,(leans forward and puts hands on the other’s shoulders) let's be peaceful.

**Atharva**: OK, fine, but this is just a social thing. Everyone knows who I am anyway. I wonder if Veronica Yan will be there.

**Dillon**: You mean the girl who dumped you in year 10?

**Atharva**: Well, look who is having the last laugh now, I can have any girl I want. I bet she'll take one look at me and realise her mistake.

**Xander**: Clearly (emphasis) 'Mr I love myself' over here hasn’t gotten over his rejection. Might explain why you are still single despite all your fame.

I am looking forward to seeing Nathan Doan, I heard he's got himself a new IT startup. I would like to know if we can link up.*straightens jacket/tie/hair*

**Dillon**: Gee, you two, you never miss a moment, do you? Atharva, stop fluffing your feathers. You treat the whole world like a Tinder date. And you, (points at Xander) not every encounter is a business meeting. It's a party! Nobody's going to want to do business deals at our reunion, and no one wants your autograph. THEY’RE OUR HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS!!!  Loosen up a bit! Have some fun! Anyway, I don't want to stay up too late. I have to run a bible study group in the morning. I don't want to do it hungover.

**Xander**: You can read the Wedding at Cana scene and tell them you were turning water into wine last night. That's one way to spice up bible study.

**Dillon**: If that's what it takes for you to come to church Xander, I will do it.

**Xander**: Nope. Sorry, Dillon, I have meetings with the execs tomorrow. I work 90-hour weeks. Tonight is out of character for me.

**Dillon**: Let God take care of your responsibilities!

**Xander**: What do you mean? Let God run my company?

**Atharva**: You just need a girl, you'll stop working so hard then. When I walk into that room, everyone's going to turn to me. I'll be able to hook you up with someone.

**Dillon**: Atharva!!! Be Careful! You’re driving too fast.

**Xander**: I think it's just this rust bucket doing a bad job!

**Atharva**: We'll be fiiiine.

**Dillon**: ATHARVA WATCH OUT!!!

*wheels screech, and you hit a tree on the side of the road. you are all dead*

*Everyone squints and shields their eyes as the angel walks on stage*

**Angel (Amelie)**: Hello.

**Dillon**:*Gasp* It's an angel! *turns to Xander and Atharva* HA! I told you!!!!! I am going to heaven and you are not!!!!!

**Angel (Amelie)**: Calm down Dillon. (Mumble here and put your hand up to your forehead in exasperation) I thought Christians were supposed to be humble. Humble christians

**Atharva**: Are we in heaven?

**Angel**: Not yet. But maybe one of you will be soon. The real question is who? Who?

**Dillon**: Well, I have been loyal to God my whole life! Surely you'll pick me!

**Angel**: I’ve only heard that one million times before. Let's see *punches numbers into the calculator*: how surprising, 99% (shows 99% to the audience) of religious people have the EXACT. SAME.  reaction. Million times, reaction

**Dillon**: What's that?

**Angel**: Oh, just my calculator. Calculator

**Xander**: Do you have to keep statistics on everyone?

**Angel**: I don't have to, I just do it to keep things fresh. When you have been doing the same job for millennia, it helps to find ways to spice it up. Spice job

**Atharva**: Is that how you pick who goes to heaven?

**Angel**: Oh, of course not! This is just a hobby. Plus it’s not up to me, I am just like the Uber driver, someone else makes the decisions. Uber driver

**Xander**: So who do you think will be picked?

**Angel**: Well, let’s see. Xander idolises money. Atharva only sees others as stepping stones for his fame. And Dillon is boastful and ungodly - he is religious by name only. None of you are fit for heaven - yet. Xander, Artharva, Dillon

**Dillon**: What do you mean ‘yet’?

**Angel**: I can give you a second chance - you will all choose 1 day of your life to go back to and prove that you are worthy of eternal life. Second chance

**Atharva**: I-I guess I want to go to when I met Veronica for the first time, so I can make things right.

**Angel**: Very well.

*Atharva walks off stage*

**Xander**: I want to return to when my parents were still alive. I wish I could say goodbye to them.

**Angel**: Wish granted. (Clap or snap on granted)

*Xander walks off stage*

**Angel**: And you?

**Dillon**: Well, I wish I could go back and spend more time with my friends and family. I guess I didn’t follow all of the bible… I’ve been a total pharisee.

*Dillon walks halfway off stage*

**Angel**: Wait. There's one more thing.

**Dillon**: Yes?

**Angel**: Now that you have faced death, your eyes have opened and you've realised what is truly important in life, what true treasure is. Go and live. True treasure, life
