Galileo Di Vincenzo Bonaulti de Galilei was an iconic Italian physicist and astronomer. Commonly known as a polymath, he was named father of observational astronomy, the father of modern physics, the father of scientific method and the father modern science. During his notable life( 15 February 1564 - 8 January 1642) he did many amazing things.

He made:

A thermometer

Aâ€‹ telescope

A celatone

A proportional compass

During his life, Galileo first inspected the act of velocity, gravitational fall and inertia using the study of science and technology investing the properties of a pendulum and numerous other inventions. Along the way he  developed the thermometer, the military compass and an advanced telescope. Later, with his telescope, he discovered the 4 main moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus and the rings of Saturn. Galileo wrote a book( the Starry Messenger) but his works were banned by the church.

Galileo's works were banned by the church. Why? Well, Galileo studied heliocentrism and believed that Earth and all the other planets used the conservation of angular momentum around the Sun. The Church, teaching against this, took him to court. Galileo spent the rest of his life in house arrest. However, when  his works were indeed confirmed, the church were forced to release the books to the public. Depressingly, the world was mourning Galileo's death.

Sadly, Galileo's works were only published after he died. He has since been described as 'An audacious hero of research' and been acknowledged widely for his discovery of  Jupiter's 4 main moons and now has a NASA satellite named after him. In 2008, a statue was erected in his honour.  His inventions are now a main part of a medical kit and his discoveries are science 101.  Galileo Galilei is now remembered as the champion of physics and science.
