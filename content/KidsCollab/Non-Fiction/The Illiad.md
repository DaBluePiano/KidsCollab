The Iliad is an epic, composed by Homer, a Greek poet, who is also famed  for writing the Odyssey. The  Iliad is known as it tells of events in the infamous Trojan War. Most people have to read the Iliad to understand the Odyssey.

Although the Iliad was first written in 750 BC, the first published book was released in 2011. So the so-called 'proper' version is nine years old in 2020. Therefore, most people don't give Homer credit for his magnificent poem. However the Odyssey is written in different books.

When Helen is abducted by the Trojan soldiers and the Greek and Trojan forces meet, it sparks a long Trojan war. Achilles, the best Greek soldier refuses to fight the Trojans. When Achilles’s friend Hector is killed in battle, Achilles goes on rage and joins the war. Paris, prince of Troy, fires an arrow at Achilles’s heel, hence killing Achilles. The Greeks win the war by building a wooden horse, putting their soldiers in the horse, letting the Trojans take the horse inside and then laying siege on Troy. This victory is very well known. The TV series Doctor Who features an episode where Doctor Who travels back in time and tells the Greek about the wooden horse plan. Captain Kirk, from Star Trek, also visits Troy but does not interfere.

The Iliad is important because it gives us an impression of the Greeks in the times of war. Also, the Iliad is a tree whose branch leads to the Odyssey, another famed poem by Homer. As well as this, the Iliad is important as it is technically an artifact - an object from the past.
