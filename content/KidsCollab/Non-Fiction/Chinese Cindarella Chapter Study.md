From the chapter of the same name in the book CHINESE CINDERELLA

Why PLT should be studied

Chapter 11 - PLT

PLT is the best chapter because it displays the emotions and the bond of the 2 outcasts of a family and how it grows both of their characters. It shows us how Adeline develops as a mother and a caring figure as she ‘suddenly felt very protective’. Adeline described the bond she had with PLT very well and provided a vivid description of the relationship between the two. The fact that she remembers the exact features of PLT shows that she has a very distinct memory of him and shows how much she holds him in his heart.

The chapter continually unites the two different cultures that Adeline has lived in. The gift that contains the 7 ducks is reminiscent of the nursery rhyme where 5 little ducks that  went out one day. And did anyone else notice that the name Bao Bei is like the cartoon show on ABC Luo Bao Bei. In fact the term Bao Bei is a common pet name in Chinese culture.

Adeline also uses engaging comedy to talk to the reader about her relationship with PLT. However some of this comedy is really just a show of her childlike innocence. She says “Do duck quacks sound different in Mandarin than in English?” This usage of comedy engages the reader with what she’s saying and also provides insight on her unique and inquisitive nature as a child and a person with Chinese heritage learning a different language, religion and combining cultures. This is shown when she asks strange questions even when the result of the answer doesn’t change anything with her situation.

Not only does the chapter show Adeline’s relationship with PLT, it also showcases how  Adeline’s other relationships grow. Aunt Baba senses how PLT has changed her and given her more responsibility and talks with her more freely and finally tells Adeline how proud she is of Yen Mah. Third Brother and Adeline find a connection in aversion of fatty food; however the connection does waver slightly

The chapter PLT also provides the reader with perceptive descriptions of PLT and her surroundings, assisting the reader to paint a vivid picture of the setting and characters shown throughout the chapter. The fact that PLT understands her like they have been together for a long time has been shown when Adeline describes her as a normal person other than Aunt Baba to actually care for her wellbeing as “ waiting for her at the door and never leaving her side. This is the special relationship the main character has with her duck and losing that someone can cause harm and the feeling of loss in her heart creating a change in attitude to her surroundings.

Another way that Adeline grows in the chapter is through the suffering she receives at PLT’s death. This is her second time experiencing grief, counting her Nai Nai’s death. You can see how much she has come to rely on PLT for comfort by her tone, and she is absolutely wrecked by her older brother’s taunting and truly inconsolable.

Scene analysis - PLT’s funeral

The scene describes Adeline and her siblings setting up a funeral for PLT, the usage of diction to draw connotations is used in words like “Bowed in respect and aching sense of loss” draw out negative and sad connotations, setting a sad atmosphere for the scene of his funeral. The funeral scene also describes the scene clearly. Descriptive phrases that tend to all 5 senses like “the fragrance of magnolia blossoms” to describe the scene and characters featured in the chapter PLT and the scene of PLT’s funeral.Hence PLT’s funeral is by far the best scene as it paints a clear picture and uses diction to describe and evoke emotion and create a detailed image of everything featured in the scene.

In conclusion, PLT combines culture, emotions, bonds, description and comedy to create a completely immersive universe and it is indeed worthy of study.
