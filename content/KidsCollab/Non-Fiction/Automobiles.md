Automobile is over 100 years old, it was created by two brothers in France, promoting their business by racing the cars they made. Now there are many types of races, because both electric and fuelled cars can race! (With their own competitions of course, they both will have different requirements).

The first TRUE race was in 1895, any competitions before that only had one competitor. The full distance of the race was 1,178 KM! (731.9753 miles for you imperial users). With the leading car only going 16.4 kph (10.2 mph)! Imagine how much hours it took them to finish the race! It was also very risky, as the cars back then could backfire any time they wanted!

Now however, there are many more races than the past. It is less risky than the past, because of the safety equipment to protect them! In fact, the latest death in NASCAR was back in 2001, where Dale Earnhardt crashed in a wall, and immediately broke his neck! Now because of that accident, there are neck protectors in every single car! Now with more teams than ever, more crashing is involved, meaning there needs to be safety to reduce fatality of the driver!

There are 10 different types of races. Each have their own requirements, but the thing they all have in common, is that they have rules, and a team to keep an eye on the car. There are only 2 main Formula races, sports car racing, stock car racing, drag races, rallying and off-road, kind of the same thing, touring, production, one make and Monster Trucks. Yes, Monster Truck performances are races. Formula, sports car and stock car racing are all the same thing. They go around a track, in a circle. Drag is a straight line – usually 200 to 400 metres (0.124274 to 0.2485485 miles). Rallying and Off-road races are usually the same thing. There’s a navigator, to tell them where to turn and when to turn. Touring consist of speed, and endurance of the car and driver. Production is where unmodified cars (nothing changed), it’s also the most economical because of the rules. One make is where cars from one car company race against each other.

The 24 hours of Le Mans is the longest race in the world, where the race is literally 24 hours, and it tests the driver’s endurance, and the cars strength, to go for 24 hours. There are 3 drivers on each team, 8-hour shifts. When racing, the F1 cars exhaust is hot enough to melt aluminium. And the oldest race still running, is the 24 hours of Le Mans it started in 1923.
