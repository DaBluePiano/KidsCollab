## <center>Snare Drum</center>

The snare drum, which is set apart from other drums because of its counter hoop, does not have a certified creator and is mostly accredited to the 1600s with its origins in Germany. However, an interesting point to make is that apparently Leonardo Da Vinci had theorized strapping a screw like mechanism to the bottom of a kettle drum, not dissimilar to a modern snare drum.

The snare drum is played like any other drum, by hitting it on the top of the drum, however many other mechanics are added, such as turning the snares off, taking away the signature rasping sound of the snare drum, and making sound like a tom, and hitting it on the rim of the drum. Because of the multiple ways of playing it, the snare drum is extremely versatile in many genres of music. It features in the drum kit, meaning that it is played and associated with the rock, concert, and jazz bands. The snare drum is in military marches to keep in time.

The snare drum has a relatively high pitch, compared to other drums due to the metal wires strapped on the bottom of the drum (called a counter hoop), giving it a raspier sound as the wires vibrate against the drum. Famous players include Ringo Starr, of Beatles fame, the more recent Will Champion, hailing from rock band Coldplay, and a legendary drummer, John Bonham, from Led Zeppelin. Bonham’s song Stairway to Heaven is proof of the expert’s speed.

The snare drum has a raspy sound, making it sometimes sound muffled, however the wires can be adjusted on the drum, meaning you can adjust the sound. The sound is often described as a ‘crack’ sound. Due to this sound, the snare drum is part of the iconic rock beat, which is often in common time, with the hi-hat alternating with the snare drum playing on the offbeat.

## <center>Gong</center>

The gong is an incredibly old Eastern instrument, hailing from somewhere near Tibet during the Bronze Age given the simplicity of making it and the sound it produces. It entered Western music in the 1600s, and later became part of the modern orchestra. The gong was originally used for religious reasons but has since been repurposed in the Western world for the orchestra. It is played by hitting the middle of the gong with a mallet hard. The gong is a metal disk that is suspended from a stand, however because of the range of mallets, rims, and materials available for the gong the pitch is very varied. The gong sounds like the crashing of waves on the shore and is one of the loudest percussion instruments. It has a long-drawn-out sound because the metal disk vibrates. The gong is usually ceremonious and thus is sometimes very ornate and valuable.

The gong is usually associated with Eastern traditional culture, most prominently Nepal and China. Famous players include Paulinho Da Costa, Frank Ricotti and James Blade, all of whom mastered the instrument to extend their percussion knowledge. The gong has an elegance in such a simple instrument.

## <center>Conclusion</Center>

The gong and the snare are vastly different in sound but similar in principle in execution. Because both instruments are percussion instruments, they are both hit. However, the snare and the gong are primarily used in quite distinctive styles of music. As well as this, both instruments are from different sides of the world. This leads to a striking difference between the timbre and use of the instruments. Players use the snare drum to rouse, to provoke and is meant to stand out from other sounds. The gong, in contrast, is used as an almost melodic instrument, echoing quiet strength with its rumble. Both instruments are vastly different, which adds more to their collaboration on the orchestra.
