Matter is what makes up everything. These include molecules, atoms and leptons. There are three types of matter; Solid, Liquid and Gas. A Solid cannot be compressed, it has its own shape and the particles are packed together tightly. They can not move freely but they can vibrate. Some solids can melt and expand when exposed to heat. They become harder when they are cool.

Examples of solids are bricks, stone and metal.

Liquids, unlike solids, can flow (the measure called viscosity) take the shape of their container. Like solids, they cannot be compressed. The particles are not  fixed into place and can move but frequently bump into each other.

Some examples of a liquid are water, milk and juice.

Gas' molecules are very far apart and can leave an empty container. They can be compressed and are usually invisible. Some Examples of Gas is: Air, Nitrogen Hydrogen and Helium and also, FARTS .

Sometimes, in certain conditions, objects can change shape and state. For example, water. When heated to the boiling point of 100 degrees , the water will turn to water vapour, better known as steam. If the steam/ water vapour is cooled to 0 degrees, it will turn to ice. If you heat the ice to above 0 degrees, you now have water again!! This process is called condensation. Generally, heat expands objects and heat contracts them. This happens because when it is heated, the particles become more distant and expand, but when it is cooled, it comes together.

When lightning hits sand, a rare and special transformation. The interesting stone is called fulgrites.

Glass is literally made out of rocks.

Honey is one of the least viscus liquids

There is a fourth type of matter-- plasma
