3D rendering will further improve the quality and engagement of history education due to the vastly different teaching method. 3D models are the rendering of sites far away in 3D to a viewer. Teachers use these models to show real-time archaeological digs and ancient buildings to students to examine in their classrooms. As the scanning and production of reliable and free 3D models is on the rise, the intended audience becomes more and more interested in them as it is an especially different viewpoint for students. Thus, students will be more engaged and focus more during lessons. As well as this, it is an easy resource and enables students to feel immersed in the lesson and learn more. For example, using augmented or virtual reality increases attention in video games, and the same effect will cause students to be more focused on the lesson through the model. Therefore, using 3D models will be beneficial to HSIE teaching because of the different viewpoints the experience provides to students.
