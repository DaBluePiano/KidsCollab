Wow What a holiday! There were ups and downs throughout. I did many things in the holiday. And learnt many things too.

First, I went camping to South West Rocks with another family from the school. It was fun. We camped and stayed at South West Rocks NRMA Holiday Park and went to Nambucca Heads on the way. We were tired when we got back home, but it was really fun. We upgraded our website/company called KidsCollab and started a magazine, a branch of KidsCollab. I also did lots and lots more of Selective School Preparations and it was really tiring and mind draining.

Second, it was Christmas! I was so excited to go to church for the nativity and, obviously, the presents! We went to our friend’s house for a Christmas lunch, and it was really yum. It was also New Year’s Day, a few days after that and it was special and the whole day was filled with fun and happiness.

Third, it was Australia Day, the 26th and it was a day of celebration. And, it was also really close to the start of school. I am excited to meet my friends again, but I am a bit concerned if something bad will happen like some one gets COVID and then the whole school will have to shut down.

In conclusion, I think that this holiday taught me a lot about how I should cope with what happens in life.
