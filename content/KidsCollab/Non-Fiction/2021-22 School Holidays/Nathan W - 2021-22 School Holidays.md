Yes, we’re going, no, we’re not,

We’re going round and round a lot

We’re moving left, moving right,

We need to leave without a fight”

Which is my poem summary of the 2021/2022 school holidays, where you’ll find a mess of jumbled decisions, and bouncing around arguments. Hence the premise of my poem.

The day we left school was conveniently the day Brad Hazard predicted that on January 1st, 25 thousand cases would hit New South Wales, with the spread of Omicron, although I’m sure Alpha, Beta, Delta and Epsilom played a significant part. Even so, this was utterly peculiar for the time, and so my family shrugged it off our shoulders, but still stayed home. So, I spent my time creating and modifying our business and website, KidsCollab, which branches of into KidsCollabMag and our games, KidsPerplex. My friends, Sidney and Adam, worked on the magazine, while my brother Jamie and I developed new games for KidsPerplex, and created obscure mathematical questions like: Express numerically: Googol squared to the power of a googolplex cubed. Which is roughly equal to about: (Number does not fit on this page)

My dad wanted to travel to the Australia Day Awards, which took place in Canberra, so we were to stay without grandparents. It was a solid plan. Sadly, my younger brother Jamie was not as excited as my older sister Emily, and I were. And so on the day of the exchange, Jamie rapidly started experiencing COVID symptoms. So we gave him a RAT test and there was a faint teasing line on the T.

Immediately everything was thrown into jeopardy – my dad cancelled his trip, and we all went to have PCR test – which happened to be negative – meaning we had a false positive.

Overall, I learnt it was always best to have a backup plan in case something drastic happens. And also, to never underestimate our Health Minister.
