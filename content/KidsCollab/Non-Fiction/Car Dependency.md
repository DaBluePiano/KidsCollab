Ever since the invention of the motor car, our cities, towns and infrastructure have been designed with these vehicles in mind. Since the end of WWII, car ownership has exploded, pushing urban development to the fringes of cities.

Some of the most notable impacts of car dependency that can be seen in cities today include:

- Closure of tramways

- Large freeways

- Sprawling low-density development

- Absence of corner shops

- Relocation of businesses to large complexes

- Reduction in public transport

One of the most notable aspects of car dependency is freeways. These are large, controlled access roads intended to bypass urban centres and provide quick and easy travel for cars and trucks. The freeway age in Australia started with the opening of the Cahill Expressway in Sydney. It was built so vehicles could bypass congested city streets and instead bypass them on the northern and eastern edges. Over the next 50 years, countless new freeways were constructed all over Australia.

While freeways are most certainly needed to improve traffic flow, for example the Warringah Freeway (M1) that bypasses North Sydney, others, such as the Riverside Expressway (M3) in Brisbane are not. Freeways divide neighbourhoods, emit noxious fumes and are a horrible waste of space. Cities all over the world have started ripping up the concrete and removing these roads. Contrary to people’s expectations, traffic congestion around the area hadn’t increased – people just didn’t do unnecessary trips. The Cahill Expressway and Riverside Expressway have the biggest support for getting removed.

Nearly the biggest change that came with car-centric development was the removal of tramways. Take Sydney for example, it had the largest tram network in the southern hemisphere. It ran over 1500 tramcars over 300km of track. However, from 1958 to 1961, hostile motoring organisations and the government forced their closure and replaced them with buses. Many residents of the affected suburbs protested. In reply, the government rolled up the wires and tarred over the tracks as soon as the last tram ran. It was clear. The trams were not returning.

The decline of high streets and the rise of shopping centres is due to the car. Traffic congestion at local town centres was getting worse. In the 1950s, the obvious solution was to make a place easier to get to in your car. This created the shopping centre. Large chains, such as Coles and Woolworths, bought up local shops and moved them into huge complexes. These boasted a variety of amenities, including supermarkets, clothing, department stores and more. Their reputation was only boosted by the fact that they had air-conditioning. With the urban-sprawl mindset, these centres helped fuel cities spreading out into the suburbs. However, nowadays, there has been a shift back to smaller business. Shopping centres are adopting a more village-like feel to draw back customers. People are slowly shifting back to the high street.

Now, the biggest and most evident in city planning: urban sprawl. Any commentary on the history of cities cannot exclude this. Urban sprawl is the spreading of development to the undeveloped land around a city. Cars made cities more accessible, so people could live further away from their work. This also fit in with the home-owning mindset of the mid-20th century and so governments incorporated it into their plans. This is bad because people are far from the services they need. Governments need to build more schools, more hospitals, more shops because otherwise people are too far from where they need to go. All this new infrastructure costs money, so much so that it is reported that it costs $75,000 more to build a new home in Sydney’s outer suburbs than in the inner city. Infrastructure Australia reported that Victoria could save $40 billion by concentrating new development in the existing areas instead of building out.

There are many changes that the car brought with it, but these are some of the biggest. Unfortunately, the biggest changes were also the worst. Removal of trams, additions of freeways, and urban sprawl are the negative consequences that came with the car. Hopefully in the future, these problems can be rectified, and the car will become a better member of our society.
