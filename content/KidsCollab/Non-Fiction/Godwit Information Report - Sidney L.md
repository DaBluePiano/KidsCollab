## Introduction

Do you know what Godwits are? Well, they are a type of bird. There are 4 main species. They are the Black-Tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa), the Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemestica), Bar-Tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica) and the Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa). The family of bird that this species of bird belongs to is limosa.

## Appearance

The most common type of Godwit is the Marbled Godwit. It has a dark, mottled back. On the Bar-Tailed Godwits it is mostly mottle brown above and has lighter uniform buff below. On the Hudsonian Godwit, its beak is pink and is it black at the tip of the beak. For the Black-Tailed Godwit, it has bold black and white wing bard that are distinctly visible in the migration flight. The legs are long and it is blue grey in colour.

## Location

The Marbled Godwit is the largest species of Godwit that breeds in Western Canada’s Prairies. The Bar-Tailed Godwit breed in the Arctic which is the coasts and tundra of Northern Asia and Scandinavia/Alaska. The Hudsonian Godwit breeds in Alaska and North Western Canada. The range of the Black-Tailed stretch from Europe to Iceland and Central Asia. Most species of Godwits follow the Alaska – New Zealand – Caribbean migration path but Hudsonian Godwits migrate south towards southern United States and through Central America.

## Diet

Most Godwits feed on aquatic invertebrates, earthworms, insects, aquatic plant tubers, leeches and small fish. It can eat seeds and berries in winter. Its long bill makes it convenient to peck at aquatic creatures that live in the mud, like molluscs. The Hudsonian Godwit feed mainly on crustaceans and insects.

## Breeding

Most Godwits breed upland and in costal tundra on the western rim of Alaska. Each egg is approximately 11% of the female’s body mass. Young fledge after 298 to 30 days after being born. Babies arrive in New Zealand after the first trans-pacific flight after they are barely 4 months old.

## Population

The Bar-Tailed Godwit’s population is estimated that it is around 325,000. 88% of all Godwits fly and migrate through the East-Asian to Australian flyway. Bar-Tailed Godwits are fully protected in New Zealand. According to the current count, the data indicates that the Godwits’ population has a drop of nearly 2% yearly. Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats that affect the godwit population. Each species has subspecies. The Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa) has two subspecies, the Limosa fedoa beringiae and the Limosa fedoa fedoa. The Bar-Tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica) has three subspecies, the Limosa lapponica lapponica, the Limosa lapponica menzbieri and the Limosa lapponica bauera. The Black-Tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) has three subspecies, the Limosa limosa limosa, Limosa limosa islandica, and the Limosa limosa melanuroides.

## Conclusion

These birds have an amazing invisible migration flight path. This bird has a very unique migratory pattern to other birds. Maybe you might see a Godwit one day?
