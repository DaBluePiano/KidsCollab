This Slam Poem needs correct pronunciation.
Guide

Tomato: American

tomato: Australian

The Australian tomato wakes up on its vine

He feels his smooth skin, he can’t help but look fine

He primes up his stems and gets ready to be picked

Instead the horse comes and he gets kicked

He lands in the crate, he gets quite a bruise

He lands into a debate he knows he will lose

The American Tomato was his best friend, you see

They talked in relish, they argued with glee

They talked about American Tomato’s homework,

And about how he just couldn’t Ketchup

And about tomato sauce, Australian tomato’s girlfriend

And how she slipped through his fingers at the very end

And of their mutual enemy - Barbeque sauce!

But they argued the most about the worst topic

It was how their kind was pronounced

Usually at this stage the tomato was trounced

For Tomato) said that it was not potaato but potato

And tomato said it was gelato, not gelayto

But the Tomato said that the consonance was wrong, see

For gelato had an l and tomato, a t

And he had tomato at a point

But today the battle extended beyond mere spelling

Both fruits rose, and started yelling

A battle of cultures, and how they were said

The fists came out, and soon there was red

Splats of juice flew over the kitchen

And then they both called on their pumpkins

Tomato laughed when he saw tomato’s pumpkin

For he said, in america, we call that a butternut squash

Tomato pulled out a jack o lantern, and soon tomato’s pumpkin was slosh

At this point, tomato knew he needed backup

He pulled out his lollies, an all round suck-up

The lollies gave him a major sugar boost

However, Tomato’s candies were loosed

And now Tomato complained about how tomato’s letters were used

He claimed they over ssd and poor z they abused

And tomato insulted america’s measurements

For miles were ridiculous for modern day implements

But then, a major threat appeared

The sauce came that they both feared

BARBEQUE sauce came to wreak havoc on them all

The giant condiment made the fruits feel so small

They knew in their minds that they would get mauled

But soon tomato proved which pronunciation was lord

For in tomato’s culture, barbeque was . . . barbie

And so their adversary was reduced to a doll

The effort of the translation took a big toll

On the tomato, and he fell down all wrinkled

He had become overripe

And Tomato lamented on the stereotypes

That had long separated the friends

He felt that both cultures should meet loose ends

BUT THEN THE FARMER CAME WiTH A KNIFE AND SOME DRESSING

And so at the end of this ballad

Both tomatoes became part of a salad
