## Background Information

Plants are the basis of the food chain and are important to our world. Their growth has been very important to monitor and many chemicals have been developed to help this process. This experiment will examine the effects of common household chemicals on the growth of plants. Due to the importance of plants, this experiment will be useful in determining new ways to help plants grow.

Plants need nutrients to grow. As long as farming has existed, farmers have added nutrients to the soil to improve plant growth, however modern chemical fertilisers were first made in 1869. The three main nutrients that plants need are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Fertilisers deliver these nutrients to the plants, thus enhancing their growth. Some of these nutrients are present in the chemicals used to treat the plants in this experiment.

Nutrients are chemical compounds used by a living organism to function and keep healthy. Vitamins, carbohydrates and proteins are all examples. Nutrients are used for almost all functions of a plant, and are essential to keep a plant alive. Nitrogen is used for stem and leaf growth. It is also important for DNA replication. Potassium is used to move nutrients through the plant. It also improves the flavour of many fruits. Phosphorus is used for photosynthesis, nutrient movement and the use of plant sugars.

Plants grow through a process called photosynthesis, through a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make food, through combining carbon dioxide and water to make oxygen and sugars. These sugars help the plant grow.

A leek plant is a member of the onion family. They were originally found around the Middle East and Mediterranean, however they are mostly grown elsewhere. Leeks look similar to a green onion, but are larger. Like other onion related vegetables, leeks have a white root stem and a leafy green top. They are used in a variety of dishes, and the middle of the leek (from the bulb to the dark green tip)  is the part usually used for cooking.

The chemicals used in this experiment are coffee, tea, sugar and salt. Each of them have a variety of nutrients used to sustain plant growth. Coffee contains magnesium, potassium and antioxidants. Tea contains minerals such as potassium, phosphorus and magnesium. The sugar used in this experiment is sucrose, which contains one glucose and one fructose (both types of simple sugars), which plants use. Finally salt dehydrates plants by making water flow back into the soil. This in extreme cases can cause the death of the plant.

A study conducted by C. Sandafur, et al, from Oklahoma State University examined the effects of dish soap on seed germination. Sunflower and wheat seeds were split into three groups each, one with tap water, another with generic dish soap and the last one with eco-friendly dish soap. The results showed that there were no significant differences between the three groups when they were grown.

An experiment for the California State Science Fair by M. Uriostegui examined the effects of household chemicals on Swiss Chard plants. Eight trials were conducted, each containing twelve plants in groups of four, each watered with a different chemical, such as bleach, pine-sol and Windex. The control group was watered with generic water. When the study was completed, the significant changes were in plants watered with chemicals, however there were no changes in the Windex plants due to the presence of ammonia in the chemical.

Therefore, this experiment aiming to examine the effect of common chemicals on plant growth, can help society by finding new ways to fertilise plants. A new way to fertilise plants would be beneficial for farming, as it will reduce reliance on other fertilisers.

## Aim

To investigate the effect of common household chemicals on leek growth.

## Hypothesis

If plants are given chemicals containing nutrients in their water, then they will grow taller because the chemicals used contain a variety of nutrients required for growth, including potassium and magnesium.

## Variables

**Independent**

Additives to water

Tea

Coffee

Sugar

Salt

**Dependent**

Height of leek plant

**Controlled**

1. Amount of water given

2. Same plant batch

3. Same size pots and soil

4. Concentration of chemicals added

## Safety

Spills of chemicals

Handle chemicals carefully and keep containers balanced

Slips and trips

Ensure hose is turned off when not in use, and donâ€™t spray water around aimlessly

Broken glass

Handle measuring jug firmly by handle

Water Leak

Ensure hose is turned off when not in use

Contamination

Do not consume any of the chemicals used in this experiment

Chemical in eye

Wear adequate eye protection and be careful when handling chemicals

Contact with potting mix

Handle potting mix according to instructions and wear gloves.

Sunburn

Wear a hat and use SPF 50+ Sunscreen when outside.

## Equipment

5 leek seedlings (around the 15cm mark)

5 black plastic pots (height of 30cm, 20 cm radius)

Large Sistema container

Garden Basics 25L Premium Potting mix

Tap water (for a full list of water quality, click here)

Pen

Notebook

Ruler

Hand trowel

Metric Teaspoon

Tupperware Containers (rounded)

500g Table Salt - Sodium Chloride

500g Table Sugar - Sucrose

30 Tea bags - Twinings English Breakfast

500g Ground Coffee - 100% Arabica

500mL Pyrex Measuring Jug

## Method

To prepare for the experiment, fill up the tupperware pots with the chemicals, tea, salt, sugar and coffee. Place these tupperware containers, notebook, ruler and pencil in the large Sistema container.

Potting Mix, Pots and Leeks laid out ready to start.

Fill the large plastic pots with 1.5kg of potting mix, leaving the soil line a few centimetres below the rim.

Place seedlings in the large plastic pots, with potting mix, labelling them 1-5, in a full sun environment, like in the picture below.

Once a day, measure the height of each plant by the tallest part of the stem in centimetres, (1 decimal place). Write down the measurements in the notebook.

Water each plant after measuring, following the instructions.

Plant 1 (Control): Receives 2 cups (500mL) of tap water.

Plant 2 (Salt): Receives 2 cups (500mL) of tap water, with one teaspoon (tsp) of table salt (sodium chloride) dissolved in the water.

Plant 3 (Sugar): Receives 2 cups (500mL) of tap water, with one teaspoon (tsp) of table sugar (sucrose) dissolved in the water.

Plant 4 (Tea): Receives 2 cups (500mL) of tap water, with the contents of one tea bag (Twinings English Breakfast) added to the water.

Plant 5 (Coffee): Receives 2 cups (500mL) of tap water, with one teaspoon (tsp) of 100% Arabica ground coffee dissolved until water is a brown colour.

Repeat steps 4 and 5 each day, for the duration of the experiment (20 days).
