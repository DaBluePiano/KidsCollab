Being sustainable is a very important thing to do because it protects our planet. One way you could be sustainable is to put rubbish in the bin. It is very imperative to do that because if you throw your rubbish on the ground, the rubbish gets caught in the drain and everything goes into rivers or dams or even oceans when it goes in there the fishes, turtles and other sea creatures think it is a jellyfish which it is their prey and they eat it. When they eat it, they get sick. So, you have to remember to put your rubbish in the bin, if anybody does not put their rubbish in the bin, you have to say “You have to put the rubbish in the bin!” or you just be kind and throw it in the bin. This is very vital that you do that in the future.  If you do not do it, it is very harmful to our environment. Approximately 3000 sea creatures are dying every second. And that’s Approximately 100,000 every minute.

You have to keep the environment clean and safe.
