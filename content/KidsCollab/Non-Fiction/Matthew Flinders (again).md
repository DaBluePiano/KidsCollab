Matthew Flinders was an English captain who was born on the 16th of March, 1774 and died on the 19th of July, 1814. Matthew was born in England and went to Cowley’s Charity in 1780 and moved to Reverend John Shinglar’s grammar school.

His family consists of his wife, Ann Chappelle and his daughter, Anne. He worked as a  Royal Navy Captain and explored Australia in 3 different voyages ( 1791-1810). On the first voyage he went to Port Jackson in 1795 on the HMS reliance and became a navigator and soon made good friends with George Bass who was the ship’s surgeon.

Flinders and Bass were transporting the new governor of New South  Wales, John Hunter to Australia and not long after their arrival they led 2 expeditions in 2 boats called Tom Thumb and Tom Thumb II and went to Botany Bay and George’s River and then to Lake illawarra.

On the second voyage he and Bass confirmed that what is now known as Tasmania was an island and on the third voyage Flinders sailed his way to the mainland of what he insisted to be called Australia and was accompanied by an Aborigine named Bungaree.
