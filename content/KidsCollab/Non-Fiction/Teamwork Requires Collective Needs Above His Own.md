One for all, and all for one. The legendary motto echoed by the Three Musketeers, copied into numerous cultures such as High School Musical and Keeper of The Lost Cities. It’s a quote that teams all over the world rally behind. Loyalty and a united front are central to their ideals because teamwork requires the individual privileges collective needs above his own.

This means to be able to work together efficiently, people should change their ideas to form a collective, or group, decision. This moral is very useful in multiple areas. For example, governments show much more power when they all agree on something, with no dissenting views, meaning that trust is built in them and that they can act much faster. Society does not want to see any system in power that always argues. Conformity is certainly required in politics. Philippians 2:5-11 shows how Jesus humbled himself to save everyone else, prizing people’s needs far beyond his own. Another way that a collective mind helps is in the military to display authority. This method dates to the Old Testament in Judges, when Gideon intimidates the Midianites into surrender with only three hundred committed men. This is why Fascist belief is so Authoritarian, to be able to have such a united and decisive front.

However, an extension of this motto, with keeping hold of a huge amount of people, is not good. The Three Musketeers work well with their virtues because there is only 3 of them and they share the same thoughts. This is not always the case. With Fascism, where they try to control the thoughts of millions of very different people, loyalty is neglected, and power is the driving force. In Pinocchio, it shows that people are very different, and you can’t try to change so many people into one thought. This also does not work with individuals as someone cannot value their own needs below someone they do not know.

The quote works in narrow confines, where people have enough shared interest to agree on most things, but when the party has millions, or even thousands, the morals intended in the argument fall behind and an Authoritarian approach is imminent. This quote focuses on loyalty, selflessness and collaboration, which extreme right views corrupt. Teamwork requires the individual privileges collective needs above his own, but teamwork also needs challenges from individuals to grow and to be able to form a collective.
