Leonhard Euler was a profound mathematician. Born and raised in Basel, he was born in 1707 and had 4 siblings. His parents were Paul Euler, who was also a mathematician and Marguerite Brucker. His siblings’ names were Johann Heinrich Euler, Anna Maria Euler, Maria Magdalena Euler and Johann Heinrich. He was destined to be a rural clergyman, but showed skill in a family of mathematicians. He took up the subject mathematics to study at the University of Basel. He studied with Johan Benoulli, and earned a masters while still in his teens.

Euler had many occupations, specialising in the areas of Mathematics and Physics. Along with these, he was a university lecturer, an author and an astronomer. When he was twenty, he was invited to the Russian Academy of Science in St. Petersburg. In 1741, he left Russia after 14 years with a blind right eye and moved to Berlin where he published a book titled ‘Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite’. From 1755 onwards, he created many new techniques that are used today in modern mathematics. One of the new techniques is the symbol ‘Σ’ which is used in many equations. He studied lunar motion which has to do with the galactic movements of the Sun, Earth and Moon, which remains unsolved to this day. He studied number theory, which is the study of integers, both positive and negative.

He accomplished many things during his life. He became a member of the Royal Society, and popularised pi (π). Pi is the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle. It is approximately 3.14159. He was recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He started encouraging the education of mathematics in Russia.

His legacy still lives on today, as he published over 500 different papers and over 25 books. A book, titled ‘Euler: A tricentennial tribute’ commemorates many of the contributions Euler has made to modern mathematics. It highlights each of the areas he contributed to and his personal and professional life.

He was described as a kind and generous man. He was loving to his 13 children, even though in his last years of his life he was completely blind. He shows that personality does not affect the work done by a mathematician. He died in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1783 at the age of 76.
