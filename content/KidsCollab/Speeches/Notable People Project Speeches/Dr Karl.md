My name is Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, pronounced Crucial - Nit -Ski! That may seem like quite a mouthful, but at least I don’t make you worry about saying all 5 of my middle names. I’m a Member of the Order of Australia, but I was actually born in Sweden. How did that happen? Let me tell you the story.

I was born on the 20th of March. I was born in 1948, following the Second World War in Sweden. My dad Ludwik and my mum Rina were actually survivors of the Holocaust, one of the most horrifying massacres of all time. When I was 2, my parents became scared of Russia, as they thought it was going to invade our country. So my parents prepared to migrate away from Sweden. Their ideal new home was the United States, but I fell ill with an ear infection just before we left. For my safety, my parents stayed in Sweden to board the next boat out. It was truly a blessing when that ship took us to Australia!

During childhood, I lived in Wollongong, although you could say I lived in the library! I loved science fiction which may be why I’m a scientist now.  I attended a private high school and went to university to get a degree in physics! About 20 years later I met my beloved wife, Mary, who is the source of all my eccentric shirts. We have 3 children and I love them so much that in 2003, I was given the prestigious title of Australian Father of the Year!

In terms of work, my first few jobs were VERY boring. One exception was when I was a taxi driver and I picked up a person who was on the run. During the chase, I got knocked out! My favourite job was when I was a doctor, however those days came to an end when I sadly witnessed the first child to perish of whooping cough in many decades. So I went over to the media to educate civilians on medicine. Now I’m an author, scientist and media communicator. I mainly work at triple j, but I also have a podcast called Sleek Geeks with Adam Spencer. I’ve written 47 books and one has even been blasted off into space! I love writing about funny things - I received an Ig Nobel Prize for my research into belly button fluff. 

I’m a 73 year old Australian who is proud of his country. I hope you are inspired by my work to don a Hawaiian shirt and tell the world about science. Don’t let your limitations get in the way. For instance, I have a disease that makes me unable to recognise faces, kind of like looking at a brick wall and trying to tell those bricks apart from each other. But that didn’t stop me from getting out there and writing, caring, even enlisting as an astronaut!
