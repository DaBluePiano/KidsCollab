The first thing that comes to mind at the time when you think about uniting the world inside of an existing event, is the Olympics. It happens every two years and unites the entire world that is going to have a sense of belonging for three weeks. The entire world unites with some that belong to the best athletes of the world representing the flag, culture, history, as well as beliefs that belong to the home country. The Olympics are about dedication, passion, unification, music, pain, stories, lives, as well as much more. The Olympics happen to be important to our world that is going to belong for several reasons.

We have an existing reason to believe for three weeks every two years. Whether rich or poor, inside of war, terrorism, fear, or illness, we are glued to smartphones, tablets, and televisions to witness history inside the Olympic games. Whether it exists as an existing athlete breaking an existing world record, or even an existing country competing for that is going to belong for the first time, it happens to be every single part that belongs to history. It makes the world remember those things.

The Olympics happen to be an existing motivational bliss. Many children, as well as adults, are going to pick up an existing racquet again, dive inside the pool, play basketball, or try a new sport. It reminds them that belongs to the importance that belongs to physical exercise. Every single one has the emotional ride we take on top of every day. Whether it exists as a that is going to belong to a moment or for an hour, we can put that aside as well as put our energies into becoming an existing fan that belongs to the world that belongs to the sport.

At every Olympic game, every single person takes memories away from it. Whether you may exist as an existing athlete, coach, volunteer, host city, or an existing fan, every single one takes long-term memories that were by it. At the Olympic games, there happens to be peace. Inside the ancient Olympics, every single war, as well as conflict, happen to be to exist as stopped during the Olympic games.

In 1993, the United Nations general assembly came together to proclaim that “all hostilities happen to be to cease during the games, thereby mobilizing the youth that belongs to the world inside of the cause that belongs to peace.” an existing few years later, the 2000 Olympic truce happened to be said: “to promote the Olympic ideals to serve peace, friendship, as well as understanding that belongs to the world.”

An example of a connection on a larger scale is, In November 2017, the relationship between North and South Korea was very tense. In PyeongChang 2018, North and South Korea chose to represent the Republic of Korea under one flag and as one team. Although it was a bit difficult at the start, where there was much political debate, they managed to push on and became very successful in the 2018 winter games.

During the same time that you can see now, there happen to be many reasons why the Olympics unite the world. Even at a time when separated by distance, we happen to be united by the Olympic games.

Thomas Bach before the 2020 Tokyo Games: “Today, the Olympics are the only event that unites the entire world in peaceful competition. All people are equal, regardless of their race, country of origin, social status, religion, or political belief. This principle of non-discrimination allows the sport to promote peace and understanding among all people.”
