Things I Can’t Live Without . . .

Ah, Australian life! In 2019-2020, bushfires wreaked havoc across the country. Then, a worldwide pandemic forced everyone into lockdown. This year we have been subject to massive floods. With all these tragedies going on, we can easily focus on all the negatives, but hardship and suffering can provide silver linings and lead us to recognise things we can’t live without. My speech will focus on 3 seemingly obscure things: bees, shortness and dying.

If a bee buzzed around you, it would be natural to be a little scared of being stung. Melissophobia, the fear of bees, affects millions of people around the world to varying degrees, especially among those who suffer from bee sting allergies. However, we should be thankful for bees because they play a key role in maintaining human life. You see, bees pollinate plants and help them grow, which is vital for the world’s crops - and our food sources! Without them pollinating, the world is estimated to only survive for another 5 years. Meaning if all bees died this year, most of us will die before we get our full driver's licence! Even though I’m scared of them - none of us can live without bees.

At 11 years old, I’m 124 centimetres tall. People my age tower over me and embarrassingly, even some kindies are the same height as me. However, being short is also one of my greatest advantages. At lunch, massive swarms of students scramble for a handball court. You would think I would be outmanoeuvred in the crowd, but no! I can squeeze in between small spaces, no matter how many people there are! I also enjoy comfort where others don’t, as although everyone gets the same amount of leg space in transport, I can stretch out. At first glance being short may be a hindrance, but it is one of the things that I truly cannot live without as it has made me accept myself for who I am.

Lastly, let’s talk about dying. No one wants to die, right? But actually, without death no one would be motivated to achieve great things, highlighted in this edited quote by Jack London - I would rather be ashes than dust! The proper function of a man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. Here, London explains that the prospect of death and having limited time on the earth spurs him to make a lasting imprint on the world. Therefore, though it’s ironic and quite morbid, I believe the prospect of dying is something everyone cannot live without as it changes the perspective about how we actually live our lives.

Australians have had a rough few years, with the pandemic and natural disasters affecting all of us. However, it has allowed us to stop and reflect on things that we can’t live without. Bees are one of my greatest fears, but if they didn't exist - neither would I! Being short can be seen as a weakness but it has helped me to focus on the positives and accept any shortcomings I might have. Dying is something no one wants, but it helps make all of our lives count and shapes our actions. Bees, being short and dying are often things we try to avoid in life but these are things I truly cannot live without as it helps me face my fears, my weaknesses and my actions.
