Well, we all know of the melodious instrument, the piano. But does any one of us know who is the person who invented this instrument? In my opinion, the most significant person in history is Bartolomeo Cristofori.

In instrumental design, Bartolomeo Cristofori is one of the most successful and influential individuals. The Italian instrument maker is regarded as the inventor of the piano, an instrument that now holds a central place in Western music. Since the middle of the 18th century, pianos have been featured in the works of many composers. Either to help them write music or as the instrument that the music was written for. There were hundreds and hundreds of composers that wrote for pianos, even today!

Cristofori was an Italian harpsichord maker. He is well known for the invention of the piano. Long ago, it was called gravicembalo col piano e forte, or basically, “harpsichord that plays soft and loud.” This name applies to the piano's ability to change loudness according to the amount of pressure on the keys. The name was later shortened to the pianoforte and now to the piano. As you may know, the harpsichord does not have control over the dynamics of the loudness or softness of the sound. Cristofori wanted to have an instrument that could have control of the dynamics. Dynamics are very important for performing music and it produces more expression which is always more interesting.

Cristofori was an artful inventor, creating such a sophisticated action for his pianos that, at the instrument’s inception, he solved many of the technical problems that continued to puzzle other piano designers for the next seventy-five years of its evolution. His acting was highly complex and expensive, causing many of its features to be dropped by subsequent 18th-century makers, and then gradually reinvented and reincorporated in later decades. Some of the features that were dropped and then reinvented were the sustain pedal and the mute pedal.

Cristofori improved his piano to the point where, by 1726, he had arrived at all essentials of the modern piano action. His frames, being made of wood in the manner of a harpsichord, were not capable of withstanding the string tension that allowed later pianos their more powerful tone.

It meant that Cristofori’s pianos were very soft in sound, but they had a lot of differences. There was a lot of control over dynamics.

Cristofori became less and less famous over time, due to court employment, centuries of improvement to make the piano better and the slowing of all adoption. Though Cristofori was the inventor of the piano, it is less clear exactly why he is forgotten outside of musical circles. He actually was not famous when he was alive, as you may think, and that is the reason why there was only one portrait of him, and he still is not famous today. Most people who invent very sophisticated things, like the telephone, like Alexander Graham Bell, are well known even today, even if they were invented a long time ago.

In my point of view, Bartolomeo Cristofori is a very important person to me and should be recognized very widely, being the inventor of the piano. If Cristofori did not bother inventing the very complex mechanisms, today, we would not have a piano! We would only be living with a harpsichord! Famous composers like Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn would not have been able to compose those very articulated dynamics and those beautiful harmonies.

I wonder if you believe that Bartolomeo Cristofori is one of the most significant people in history. I wonder what you think the most significant person is?
