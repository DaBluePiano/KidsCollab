Inventions have taken us far, beyond the moon. , They have improved our quality of life with fridges, air conditioners and television being daily necessities. They give us not only what we need but what we want. Last year I realised the significance of little things, things that kept us safe like QR codes and hand sanitiser. However, it must be said the most popular and the greatest invention has to be….Toilet paper!

Humans have always needed to wipe their bottoms somehow, stone age people most likely used the available rocks or moss and ancient China employed bamboo sticks. Not exactly ideal for comfort. Ancient Romans sat in a local toilet together and shared sponges on sticks called terrariums to clean their mess. You heard right, the sticks were reused for different people. So, the world before toilet paper was pretty messy. However, when toilet paper became popular, it established a new age of luxury.

The year was 1391, and China was mass-producing toilet paper down the Silk Road, making 100 million 1-ply sheets per year. They even made special perfumed sheets for the reigning dynasty. In the 15th century, paper became widely available and poor people used newspapers as a substitute. Meanwhile, in the Western world, toilet paper had unfortunately not been established so civilians were using corn cobs. That was until 1857 when Joseph Gayetty of New York made Gayetty’s medicated paper, the first commercial toilet paper brand. He very modestly had his name printed on every single sheet. It was so good that the Library of Congress called toilet paper “the greatest necessity of the age!”

In 1973, there was the Great Toilet Paper Scare. The US was experiencing shortages of pretty much everything. One politician said: “we may face a serious shortage of toilet paper within a few months…we hope we don’t have to ration toilet tissue…a toilet paper shortage is no laughing matter. It is a problem that will potentially touch every American.”

A comedy writer for the Tonight Show heard this but missed a tiny detail - may face a serious shortage. So, when the show’s host Johnny Carson stepped onto the stage to deliver a joke, he said there was an acute shortage of toilet paper. This gag sent his 20 million listeners scrambling, and the shelves were emptied even faster than last year’s crisis. Later, one woman told the press she bought 15 extra rolls and another said she wouldn’t let guests into her house without an admission fee of 1 toilet roll. Forget Bitcoin - they should have called it “buttcoin”! This proves how much people needed toilet paper even 50 years ago! And we shouldn’t laugh at America. Did you see Australian shelves last year?

So, the history of the wipe has had its ups and downs, from corn cobs to perfume sheets to buttcoin! Without it, poop-smeared rocks would be everywhere or worse, terrariums would still be a thing!! And as last year showed, toilet paper is a luxury we have grown to rely on. That’s why toilet paper, the hottest thing on the shelves a small but pivotal creation, stands out to me as the greatest invention of all time.
