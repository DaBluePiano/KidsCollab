Fire blazes across the land, putting us in an endless heatwave; killing native Australian animals and destroying forests. Droughts and floods start to increase in Australia thanks to global warming. A deadly virus sweeps through the world and turns into a pandemic, putting everyone into lockdown. We have run out of toilet paper, surgical masks, food, and all hygiene appliances. Everything is cancelled. 2020 has been a chaotic year and was not even close to finishing the year. 2020 has been different, and yet I know it will stay in my memory for the rest of my life. 
 
In Australia, the bush fires continued over from 2019 and brought catastrophe to the bushlands that make up so much of Australia. The bushfires continued all the way till March and destroyed the homes of millions of native species. Millions of plants were burnt to the ground taking with them even more humans and animals. This is all because of global warming, which every one of us caused. We were affected by the huge heatwave and the loss of so many Australians and animals. 
 
Global warming was always a large issue in Australia, but in 2020 the weather became topsy turvy. The floods in the city and the droughts in the country meant our water was not evenly distributed. Many suffered from the loss of crops and dehydration.
 
The COVID-19 cases started entering as the bushfires finished, and with them came death, shortages of Hygienic appliances, quarantine, the fall of the economy, and the cancellation of everything. As the virus swept across Australia's dusty plains, our lives changed and turned chaotic. 5 visitors to 3 and then to 15 and back to 5. Singing got banned yet sport continued. The COVID-19 pandemic created confusion and made it harder to live our lives normally. School excursions that were looked forward to getting banned as did intergrade communication. 
 
In the end, we are still going and trying to get through 2020 and it's been tough on everyone. While we do wish that we could fast forward to 2021 we need to hold on to the good memories and keep on trying to live the best life we can even in a pandemic
