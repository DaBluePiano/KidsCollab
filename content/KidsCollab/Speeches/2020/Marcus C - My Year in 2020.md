2020 what a very unusual year for all of us from the black summer fire to the dreadful coronavirus, a short name for the COVID-19.
 
The black summer fires were bad, some people have lost their homes and got wounded badly. Many Australian native animals are under threat and extinction in the fires. 

I had to stayed in the classroom instead of playing on the oval but honestly that was okay, but the worst event that has occurred is the coronavirus. COVID-19 has affected me in many ways such as not being able to go to shopping with my parents. The challenging part by far is working from home. Working from home was the hardest thing I have done this year. The most challenging part I found was when I had some questions that I was unsure about, I was not able to have a face-to-face conversation with my teacher.


However, I did really enjoy working on the computer, I do not normally use the computer every day. 

We were not able to go out to eat because the March lock down restriction, instead we decided to stay home to cook and keep us safe. We bought 3 bags 20 kilo of rice and we have almost finished them in six months!

Many of us may say COVID-19 is bad, but it is actually good for the environment, a lot of manufactory companies reduced or stopped their production lines and this helps to reduce the level of air pollution, people can see the blue sky more often in the polluted area such as China as an example.

It was my birthday in June during the lock down period, I celebrated my birthday with family and friends differently. I received a happy email from my friend. During the COVID 19 lock down, I was able to see my parents 24/7. My dad took two months off and mum works from home since March. It was great to see my parents a lot than usual. 

The one I dislike about online working is not able to see my friends, sure I got to email them, but that is no whereas near as fun as talking to my friends about tennis and other things. Then the day came, when COVID 19 cases are under controlled, and we were finally able to come back to school. Back to school was just like school all over again, just with friends and it really was not that bad.

It was so much easier working at school than working from home. After about two weeks, 4L moved into a new classroom. I might not be able to go to a new building like my brother who is in Year 6, but at least, I got a new classroom. 
 
In my old classroom I only had table and chairs. But now in my new classroom, we have a wet room, a reading room, circle tables and chairs, wobble chairs, a jellybean table, and my favourite type of furniture booths.
 
Giving face masks are now mandatory in Victoria, and strongly recommended wearing masks in some situation in NSW and QLD. Lucky for my grandmother was able to make fabric face masks. Mum really enjoying wearing mask when she does her weekly grocery shopping. 
 
I am a pianist, and I meant to take my grade 3 exams in April, guess what the day is? Way past April. Now I would need to take my exam in September. However, with the COVID restriction, face to face exam in 2020 has been replaced by video repertoire exam. A video repertoire exam is when a student is required to go to the music teacher studio and the teacher will record the pieces of music the student played and send it to the AMEB (Australian music examination board). 
 
2020, what a year! it has been sad and great, the bush fires, COVID-19. In 2020, I have transferred from an old classroom to new classroom. I had to stay inside instead of playing on the oval due to the fires and I had to work from home to just like everyone else so we can stop the community spreading of the virus. 2020 is a definitely unforgettable year as other years may not be like 2020 and how is yours?
