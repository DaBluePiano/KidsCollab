In 2019 I was collecting Pokémon cards. But this year I was on the hunt for toilet paper. New vocab, new diseases, new bikes and new ways of learning, 2020 has been an exhilarating and uncertain year.

In 2020, I’ve been learning a lot of vocabulary. Who knew that social distancing was a thing? And don’t get me started on isolation or quarantine or pandemic or coronavirus. I’ve learnt countless new words and know what they mean. Covid 19 has taught me new vocabulary.

Online learning is a major component in my year. Even band rehearsals moved online due to health guidelines. I learned a lot about technology and was able to communicate via email and facetime.  But then I missed face to face learning and my friends, meaning I couldn't say goodbye to my friend Adam when he left to go to Dubbo. It’s hard enough saying goodbye to a friend, but I couldn’t have a farewell party or even give Adam a hug. Overall, though, online learning is at the top of my 2020 favourites chart.
This year I got a new bike and our family, rode a lot. Although the journeys were tiring, my sister, dad, mum, brother and I persevered. We went to Rouse Hill, Kellyville, Balcombe Heights and sometimes just to Roxborough Park. We learnt shortcuts and cycle ways and we also learnt that we are lucky to live in such a luscious area with lots of natural environment. Not only did we ride, but my family also went bushwalking and further appreciated our community.

The biggest thing everyone was talking about though (apart from coronavirus) was the shortage of toilet paper - shelves were completely empty! Every once in a while, I stopped and thought ‘poor toilet paper makers. I remember being so excited at the sight of toilet paper and when our mother brought in “toilet paper ground rules”. If I could rename the pandemic, I would call it the down under toilet paper apocalypse.

2020 has been an uncertain but exciting year. I mean, not every year has a pandemic in it! And the year’s not over yet! Soon, I’ll turn 10. One day, I’ll look back on my tenth year and remember that in 2020 not only was I collecting toilet paper and vocab, but I was also collecting memories.
