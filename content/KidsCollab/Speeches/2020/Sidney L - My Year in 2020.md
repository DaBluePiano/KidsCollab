2020, the year that changed everything. Everything. Absolutely everything. 2020 was planned to be a phenomenal year. But as soon as I got my classes, bad news hit. It was predicted that I had to home school. I wondered what would happen. 
 
It was what reversed our world, the economy, and our lifestyle. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. It has troublesomely affected me in many ways, like the homeschooling, at first it was dreadful and later I found out the good sides of it. The negative things were that I couldn’t see my friends. I was yearning to even catch a glimpse of them. Every day just dragged on like as if it was like forever. But things dramatically changed. I could go back to school again! But there were still a few changes, like I had to bring my drink bottle every time I had to go somewhere and sanitize too. Despite all the changes, I was very grateful for what had happened. 
 
Also, I couldn’t see Adam when he was about to leave for Dubbo, at the end of term 1 because I had to stay home, I couldn’t say bye to him, but in many ways, I can be in contact with him with either Google Meet or even Zoom. I am very grateful that there is this type to technology so that I can still be friends with Adam. 
 
This year, I also started band! I was very fascinated about how they play all the instruments; I was in Percussion where I am now learning how to play the Snare, Tom, and 4 tom and even now, I am learning how to do the kick drum! Even though I started a bit late for my age, and it seemed a bit easy, I have made many friends in the band, and it sounds amazing when we play as a band. But as you may already know, COVID-19 has struck so every second week we do Theory and the week after that, we so a zoom meeting to play our instrument. 
 
The school had major improvements in 2020, the new building, has many new and wonderful things in it like the library, and a lot of classrooms. They weren’t all for just one use, they could be used for band, which could be used for ERA things and presentations. There is also the new refurbished D Block. It is where I learn, have fun, and sometimes go crazy, and even now, I am doing my speech in here! 
 
Also, there is a playground improvement program that is sustained to help the future of our school better and make futures stand out. My group has made mind-blowing suggestions and I hope that can happen very soon. 
 
My year in 2020 has been a wonderful and adventurous ride. How about your year?
