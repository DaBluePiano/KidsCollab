An Apple A Day Keeps The Doctor Away…

What do you think An Apple a day keeps the doctors away means???

You might be asking “Where does this ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’ proverb come from?”

Well, this proverb actually comes from Wales, a very big country in Britain and was popularized from “Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread.”

But then, you’ll be asking, “Now that I know that where ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’ comes from, but I don’t know what it means!”

“An apple a day keeps the doctor away” is a very popular 19th century proverb which means that eating an apple a day will keep you away from the doctors for less regular check-ups than now. How amazing is that! By just eating one apple day can keep you from the doctors forever!?

So, an apple a day keeps the doctor away… How? Well, there are many vitamins in our delicious apples! There are vitamins like Vitamin A, B12, C, and, last of all, Vitamin D.

These vitamins are very good for your body and your immune system and some may even prevent you from getting illnesses and diseases that you don’t really want to happen in your body.

So, now you know that apples have Vitamin A, B12, C and D, but then what are they used for??

Vitamin A is needed for the smoothness and the formation of the skin.

There are Vitamin B12 in our apples and, as an alternative name, cobalamin. Vitamin B12 is beneficial by reproducing red & white blood cells.

So, Vitamin C gives you calcium and bone health so your bones grow stronger and healthier.

Vitamin D protects you from severe sunburns and may even prevent you from skin cancer.

Apples can help you in many ways but the most important thing to remember is that by just eating one Apple a day, it can save your life!

Apples are best in nutrition especially when you eat it with the without peeling the skin. You can still eat it by peeling the skin, but it will give you less nutrition.

Well, here’s a question that you might want to answer.

“If I eat an apple a day, will that improve my eating habits??”

Yes, it will change your healthy eating habit by eating heathier and having a healthier life!   You will feel that you will have more energy than before!

But then, if you’re thinking that you don’t really like apples and you still don’t want to see the doctors that often, you can try to eat alternative fruits like Bananas, Kiwis, Grapefruit or Watermelon.

In conclusion, I highly recommend to just try eating one apple a day and as I said, you will be much healthier, happier and full of energy!
