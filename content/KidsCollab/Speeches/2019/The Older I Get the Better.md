When I was 8 weeks old, my parents had to carry me around everywhere and I couldn’t walk or talk. At 8 months old I still couldn’t really walk or talk - but now at 8 years old look at me - I can both walk and talk. As you can see the older I get the better I am and that is why growing up is the greatest.

Firstly being older means being able to work. Most people think of work as a bad thing, but if you have a job then you get paid. We can earn money ourselves and buy whatever we want. For example you can have a real car that drives rather than just some pretend Hot Wheels. Not only can you buy objects, but you can buy experiences such as travelling to another part of the world . Earning money through work is one reason why growing up is the greatest.

Growing up means having many years to learn a lot. You can graduate from school, perhaps even university, and your knowledge would be far beyond what you can imagine right now! Science, literature, mathematics, geography - you’ll be able to understand all kinds of things that seem so complicated right now.
There are also many great movies we can’t watch as kids because they are rated M or above like Avengers Endgame - when we get older we will be able to enjoy them rather than just reading the comic books about them. Growing up is the greatest as we can gain knowledge and watch really cool movies.

So far I’ve explained how growing up is great for you. But when we grow up it’s also great for others. For example, think about your poor parents - they have had to deal with changing our nappies, vomit not to mention tantrums. Luckily for them, in the future they won’t have to look after you because you can look after yourself. Also, don’t tell anyone, but your teachers will probably be glad to get rid of you after many years of putting up with your childish behaviours. Therefore growing up is the greatest for all kinds of people around you .

Everyone loves getting older. I used to sit in a highchair and not be able to talk, walk or even stand up but here I am now, at 8 years old doing all three! There are even more things I have to look forward to like work, money, knowledge and movies when I’m 18, 28 and beyond. Growing up is the greatest!
