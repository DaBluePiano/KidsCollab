Do you know the Muffin Man?

Are you familiar with a black sheep?

Or perhaps you’ve heard that London Bridge is falling down?

For centuries, parents have taught children simple jingles known as nursery rhymes.But do you know where these songs came from and what they mean? Here are the origins of three well known rhymes that have a much darker meaning than you might suspect . . .

Humpty Dumpty is the world’s most famous egg. In a story included in Lewis Caroll’s Through the Looking Glass, apparently he sat on a wall, had a big fall, and couldn’t get back up. Which is a rather strange life for an egg. That’s because the original Humpty Dumpty was a cannon used in the English Civil War. The wall it was stationed on was destroyed and because the cannon was so heavy, the soldiers could not get it operational again. Or maybe not. Evidence is emerging that the real Humpty Dumpty was actually King Richard III and the song was about his downfall. Just remember next time you watch Playschool . . . You might see a former English Monarch in the form of an unusually dressed plush egg.

Now, I don’t know about you, but whenever I think about English architecture, I always think of the London Bridge. The poor bridge has been falling down for centuries now. There are many theories as to how this odd little rhyme came about, none of them good. One theory references the line ”take a key and lock her up’. This suggestion stems from the legend that when they took down London Bridge in the 1830s, bodies were found in the bridge. The theory says that as a sacrifice to some unknown gods or idols, they would lock people up in the bridge and the song was a plea to let the victims go. And of course, why not sing it to children?

One of the more problematic jingles is that of Baa Baa Black Sheep. An instantly recognisable tune in western society, Baa Baa Black Sheep has multiple layers to a simple song. It is \agreed that the song was first introduced in 1744, emerging in England. People conclude that this may mean that the rhyme is about the introduction of the salt tax, and how much people were taxed with the giving out of the ‘wool’ to the master and the dame. But . . .why is the sheep black? Many say this points to African slaves, and how many slaves were given to their respective masters, as the original lyrics do not include the boy down the lane. Salt tax or slaves, Baa Baa Black Sheep is definitely one of the most controversial songs sung to babies.

Nursery rhymes are commonplace in society today. However, maybe we should reconsider teaching the songs to children and toddlers, based on their dark history. Previously they were used as protests, warnings, pleas or complaints.. For example, the Muffin Man was a serial killer. And the old man in It’s Raining It’s Pouring dies in the second line. Maybe, the next time you babysit and decide to turn on Cocomelon, just stop. Think. And sing Baby Shark to them instead. Wait, does anyone know where that one came from?
