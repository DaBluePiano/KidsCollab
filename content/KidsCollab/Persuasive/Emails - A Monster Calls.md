Dear Ms Generic Teacher,
This letter details my concerns for my child regarding the novel that you are currently studying, A Monster Calls. My child is often quoting moments from the book and from these extracts, I fear that this book is inappropriate. This novel contains coarse language and exposes unnecessary explicit scenes in the novel. It also deals with death in a way that children at this age will not identify with, and children will not understand what he is thinking and why that is, leading to them corrupting the stories and making derogatory jokes that may well impact another child going through similar struggles. It also carries the burden of being confusing in the context of society today, and provides a different perspective to what pop culture says, leading it to be dismissed and the larger points ridiculed. 


Overall, this novel seemingly projects a misleading image that encases coarse language, explicit moments that are not needed. This type of text carries too big of a burden for a child to understand and has ignited my concerns or my child studying this inappropriate book. The whole point of the book is to show how humanity is ambiguous and by extension, I believe that the concept of this book and what it implies is also ambiguous and dangerous to read for a Year 7 with an unsteady mindest. Please consider my concerns and switch the focus of the current unit to a well-meaning book so that my child may learn morals and not strange nonsense.
From Mrs Generic Mother


Dear Mrs Generic Mother,
On your complaint about A Monster Calls. You argue that this book is not suitable for study due to a childâ€™s immaturity. Quite the contrary. This book will teach students what it is like to be mature and appropriate emotional response, reconciling with the most human aspects. You also say that they are being exposed to explicit scenes, however they are currently being taught this and more in their PDH classes 3 times a fortnight. As well as this, this book goes deeper than society goes in terms of thoughts and the justification of truth and ideal, good and evil. 


The harrowing scenes add to the clarity that is provided with the narrator's thoughts and they are true to what an actual person would feel in this situation. You are therefore advocating restrictions of views. While you mollycoddle one student, you take away the right of another to learn and to grow from the text. You also disagree with the view that characters are all ambiguous and how this impacts mental health. This will in fact aid mental health and advocates the moral of Yin and Yang, believing there is good in everything. I believe that your viewpoints are actually affected by your own view of society and wanting to fit in - the very thing we want to prevent. I hope you take my words into consideration and please note that I will continue this English unit studying A Monster Calls.
From, Ms Generic Teacher
