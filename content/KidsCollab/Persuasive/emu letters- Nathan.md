Dear 4L,

I  thank you for your catering, giving me a daily massage in exchange for holding the door. But my concern is that  because of the massages I have now become obese! At night I try to move but instead I slump down, sand trickling from my belly. Maybe you could pick me up sometimes and play catch? You could even use me as a dumbbell! Just let me get some exercise ,okay?

Your satisfied but obese friend,

Edwin

P.S Iâ€™m pretty sure my job description is an emu, not an obese emu.
