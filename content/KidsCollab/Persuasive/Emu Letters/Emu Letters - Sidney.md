Dear 4L,

You are the worst of the worst class ever!

You get to play at 11 o’clock and 12:40 every day, and do I get to play?

No.

Absolutely not.

I never get to play during school times. I always have to wait for more than 9 hours until I at least get to walk around the classroom.

Anyway, after school at night I always walk around the classroom and play jelly truck, 2048 and Boxel 3D on Mrs Lees’ computer.

I have always yearned to tell you something. Do you see that mini emu sitting on the bench behind the coffee mug and the circle thingy?

That is my brother Bobby. I really want you to bring him down so that I can play with him after school.

Also, I am going to blow up if you put one more drop of hand sanitizer on me, as you know that it is flammable. Please stop doing that. I wish I could be in 4H or 4B but do you know what? I’ll give you another chance. (If you change)

Your annoyed but forgiving friend,
Bob the Emu
