Dear 4L,

hello 4L, I have been experiencing many hurting times. I know my purpose is to block the door, but I do not want to be kicked, I feel so good when you are not in the classroom, but as soon as I see you I fell so depressed when you come in. When I am at home by myself, I always gaze up upon emu blue, he just  stays in a shelf all day and guess what I get kicked every day. If I had one wish it would be to swap jobs with emu blue. Out off all my years off being a door stop, 4l has been my worst class. That is because the spiteful boy Jordan that kicks me every day. I have heard you argueing about my name It is senior emu blue.

From your depressed friend, 

emu blue
