Dear 4L

Have you noticed me? Sure, I am a <strong> DOOR HOLDER </strong> but I don’t like how you treat me. I know you are lavish but not that stupid maniac. I am an Australian animal, I’m on the 50 cents so I’m famous. You treat like a soccer ball. I have been in operations luckily, I have been repaired from your beloved teacher (Mrs Lees). When you’re out, I try to stand on my feeble feet however, I slump down. I am obese. I hate all of your annoying boys: Oscar He (the stupid child), Jordan Hayton (the Comedian) and Ganeev (the idiot). This horrible morning, Jordan Hayton had kicked me and I couldn’t see anything. On the following morning, Mrs Roach had also kicked me and I might say you are the WORST CLASS EVER!! How will read when you drop sanitiser on my eyes

<strong> From your angry friend
EMU </strong>
