7am

We’re packing up for a big trip while I write this. We’re sorting out a lot of stuff and packed it into the car. The car is so stuffed that between me and Felix there was a pillow, and air fryer and a swimming bag! It was so cramped. And wow, we are about to take off to our trip.

7:15am

I’ve been waiting a very long time here! We’re still sorting out… nearly finished, and I’m going to be wiped out when we get to the campsite. I’ve had frenzy with my seatbelt because it was so squeezy with the air dryer box.

7:30am

Wow. We planned to set off at 7am and look at it now! 30 minutes late. We are finally leaving… and… 567km to Port Macquarie. What a beautiful day it is! It is cool outside, and it is a great start to the trip.

8:10am

We’re on the M1 Motorway and it is raining rock hard and we pray and hope that it would not be rainy when we get to Arrawarra. Usually by now, I would be asleep or something. Something is keeping me awake. The rain? The road? Dunno. Dad said that of we’d drive this fast, (110km/h) we’ll hope to get there (Port Macquarie/Arrawarra) by 12pm. Who knows? There was a sign where it said that if it was not raining , you could drive at 100km/h, but if it WAS raining, to drive at 90km/h and we just past the rain like 800m ago! Funny it suddenly stopped.

8:25am

We’re going up some sort of descent and, yes, we were still on the M1. We’re going to be on there for at least another 85 km. We usually wake up on weekends currently. But we are already 56km in. I’m just going to rest now.

9:45 am

We’ve just stopped to fill up the tank and go to the loo, and we’re still on M1 Motorway. While we’re on a very bumpy road, I still am trying to write. And I am writing with the pen that Mrs. Lees, my Year 4 teacher gave me yesterday. There’s becoming to be more trees along the way and most of them may have been affected by the horrid Black Summer Bushfires.

10:00am

I am very tired and excited to go to the Port Macquarie Koala Zoo. I wonder how far it is form Port Macquarie to Arrawarra. I hope not any more than 80km!

10:05am

I am so shocked Mum told me it was about 2 hours. I wonder how long we’ll be in the car for… close to 6 – 7 hours? It feels like we’re going nowhere. Just trees and trees. I really hope we reach a town somehow.

1pm

We’ve just left the Koala Hospital after seeing some injured koalas. Sadly, some of them had to be permanently rehomed in the hospital. We’re heading to Arrawarra with 194km on the stocks for us. Wow. Some roads don’t have curbs. Funny, Hey!

1:30pm

I just had an ultra-yummy subway with ham, cheese and tomato bread roll and a rainbow cookie. We are now actually heading to Arrawarra. Fingers crossed nothing will go wrong! We’ve got 190km to go so…

3:35pm

We are only 15km from the campsite, but it is RAINING! Everyone wonders how we’ll set up the tent. Hope, and fingers triple crossed it’ll be better.

3:40pm

Damn that. Doesn’t look like it is going to get any better. Not a smidge better. All we can see in the front window is just white droplets and gas from the cars in front of us. I mean we have never been setting up a camp tent on a rainy day! I wonder when we’re going to the activities . we have gone significantly slower and I noticed that it wasn’t raining rock hard. It was the speed of the car that the raindrops on the highway hit the window very hard because we were driving at somewhat 110km/h. now I think it is possible to set up the tent.

3:50pm

YAY! We have arrived at the holiday park and it is raining very lightly. I am very relieved.

4:20pm

We are waiting in the car for the rain to pass and I’ve been in here for about 15 minutes. Before, I got drenched in the rain. We haven’t even put up the tent yet! This is so annoying and cold. I wonder when we can do it. I really wasn’t to go to the jumping pillows and the water park.

4:55pm

I am now waiting for mum and dad to set up the tent and blow up the air mattress and stuff. Dad forgot to close the door, so water is spraying on me.

5:30pm

We are heading to Woolworths in Woolgoolga. 7km. that is a whole long way to go to the shops. I wonder what we’re going to buy? We are going to eat pasta tonight.

Late

We are fighting a moth in the tent for about 10 minutes and finally we killed the fly. Then it took for me around 20 – 30 minutes to sleep. An end to a brilliant and very wet day.

6:30am

Mum and I just woke up and took for a walk around the campsite. It was brobdinagian! I  felt like I could get lost wherever I went. We ate breakfast, I had Heinz Beans ™ and croissants. Felix and I are both very excited to ride on the go-kart.

9:10am

I’ve hopped in the car and we are about to the Coffs Harbour, The Big Banana and the aquarium. We hired the Go-karts from 4:00 to 4:45pm. We are also hiring the Bikes from 9am to 6pm tomorrow. (Maybe if it doesn’t rain.) I am looking forward to the water play after the Go-karts. We have 2 singles so that we can do it separately.

9:20am

I am writing very frequently now bevause I am very bored when sitting in the car. I really want to go to the water park with a double water slide and a big tennis and lawn bowling complex. We actually just did some tennis pm the damp clay tennis courts.

12:55pm

About an hour and a half ago, when we got to the aquarium and when we finished and we got out, I got a slap watch. Just then, we arrived at the Clog Barn and we ate the best lunch ever. I had chicken nuggets and chips while Felix had Ice-cream, pancakes and chocolate sauce. Right now, I am waiting in the car for mum to come out of the Holland-type garden. I think when we go back, we’ll go to the water slide and then go-karting.

2:20pm

We just came out of the Big Banana and the candy shop and I got an orange cased, black pen from there. I just ate a Banana split with cream and Ice-cream! (Bananas, right?) We are heading to the Plaza to get some food for tonight’s BBQ. (We changed from pasta to BBQ)

2:30pm

Mum just got shopping while we are sitting in the car and it is golly getting very boring.

4pm

We are on the go-karts and it is very fun although we kept going in one-way streets. It was raining heavily in the middle when Felix and I were on the other side of the NRMA holiday park. It is pretty enjoyable on the go-karts.

Late

We remembered we had carols on the driveway that we watched on the computer broadcast 600km away and some people made shoutouts and one of them were us and they were like “Shout-out to the Lam family. In a tent?!”

<br></br>

8:30am

I had just woken up and it was raining rock hard and the top of the tent was flooding. I helped Mum barbecue the crumpets. I hear you ask, ”Why? BBQ Crumpets?” Beats me.

9:50am

We went to the activities hut and we did some craft and played with a lot of gems. (Plastic of course.)

11:05am

We are in the road to Woolgoolga beach and it is still raining, and we’ll have fish and chips. Mum said that we’ll be dumped in the water parks after we come back. I am really hungry, so I hope to have a good lunch.

1pm
We are at the water park and I ma having a lot of fun like going down water slides and playing with Felix. But the sad part of that it is was raining and it was so cold Mum told me my lips were blue. We are going to play until around 4 o’clock.

Late

Felix and I both played billiards. (Well, not EXACTLY.) We only had cue balls and we rolled the balls into the billiard pockets.

After, we had dinner and it was BBQ bacon and fried noodles and some lettuce.

8:30pm

Mum and Dad had to go and have a shower, so Felix and I  stayed at the games area.

<br></br>

## Tuesday, 15th December 2020

7:05 am
I just woke up and we are eating bagels in the tent and yes, it is still raining. Not raining ROCK hard but METEOR hard. I mean it rained so hard that the water from the top layer of the tent dripped to the second layer covering us.

7:20am

We went to Woolworths in Woopi to get some garbage bags to put all the wet stuff in. I mean the shops (Just to get one thing) was like 5km away. Do you even go to the shops that long distance away? At this rate, raining is pouring down at about 100mm+/24hr.

8am

Felix and I went to the Arcade Room while Mum and Dad packed up the tent.

10am

We are setting off for Bingara and I am really excited to see our friends. We are going to stop at around Glen Innes to see the rocks and have lunch.
12:15pm

We are at Glen Innes and I had a great lunch. I had chicken schnitzel and burger and scones. We are going to set off to Bingara.

4:11pm

We are around 27km away from our friend’s place and I have been told there is a new swimming pool in Bingara. Just then, our Tyre Monitor beeped and it read that my tyre (Back Right) was 45 pas, and 108 degrees hot. Crazy. Anyway, we are encountering a first traffic light since Grafton. It is on Gwydir Highway and it is very long staying on red. We also never expected a traffic light on Gwydir Highway.(A38)

4:30pm

We had arrived at Bingara and we are unloading and spreading out all the camping gear to dry them.

6:30pm

We are eating out at the pub eating Chinese food. My favourite one was the honey chicken.

Wednesday, 16th of December 2020

 8am

I woke up from the first night of sleeping in Bingara. I played the piano, about a few tones out of tune.

10am

We are going to a walk around town in the Bingara town centre. We browsed a lot of small shops and a lot of them were antique. We even saw 1975 – 1978 school magazines! Wow! So, we bought them for $30 for the lot. (About 130 magazines.)

We had a lot of fun in the shops. Looking at old things made me realize that Bingara was a pretty old town

2pm

We are heading to the newly refurbished Bingara War Memorial pool. And yes, it was new. It was so new that residents of the Gwydir Shire Council could go in for free.

3:30pm

I am still in the pool and Rainbow and Addison came to the pool after finishing their last day at Bingara Central School.

4:15pm

We arrived back in Junction Street with Rainbow and Addison to have afternoon tea. We had custard and apple pie and Ice-cream (Which WAS planned) and we had mini donuts and cakes (which was NOT planned). But that, I could say, was the best afternoon tea we've ever had. It was THE BEST.

Thursday 17th December 2020

8am

We woke to an ordinary start, with toast with a lot of vegemite. We were going to Inverell.

10am

We are setting off to Inverell to see some antique and op shops. It was only up the road, 75km, a short 50min trip.

11am

We are at Inverell and we are going to three shops. One the Salvos (The Salvation Army), the Community House and Vinnies.

2:15pm

By the time we finished with the Community House it was 2:15pnm and the Vinnies close at 2:30pm, so we legitimately had only 15 minutes to get something quick there. Since we hadn’t finished at the Community House, we had to rush back before 3:00pm.

3pm

We are having our second Subway and I was having a foot-long Ham, Cheese and Tomato bread roll and a double choc chip cookie.

4pm

We are heading back to Junction Street and Jan (Rainbow’s Grandma) had set up afternoon tea which was vanilla ice-cream.

Late

We had a watchamacalithingy like money bag and spring rolls. We watched TV for the rest of the night, and we had a very good time and went to sleep.

Friday, 18th December 2020

7:30am

We woke up for breakfast, Sultana Bran and it was also Felix’s Birthday. And just after breakfast, he received his birthday gift with an unexpected 9th birthday card. He was turning a full 8 not 9.

8am

We went out for tennis and it was swelteringly hot. After 10 minutes of playing with mum, I was worn out. And something like 10 minutes later, Jan, Rainbow and Addison rocked up and I’m like “What!?” it is so hot that I have to do another round of tennis. We played doubles with Rainbow and Addison versus Me and Mum. Now at the end I was gone. Too hot. Sweat was dripping down my nose.

12pm

My Dad drove our family and Addison back and left Rainbow and Tony at the tennis courts the Jan came to the tennis courts to see If they were there and they weren’t visible. Then my Dad went to pick them up and they’re like , “We didn’t see that damn car!” Then we had Ice-cream and sat for 4 hours watching try not to laugh on Addison’s laptop and it was not a cracker. It was just a person, who jumped to the other side and being such an idiot that he fell back. Not funny.

4pm

We went down to the pool and we played the exact same thing for 1 ½ hours and we thought when we came out, that it would be the last time seeing Rainbow and Addison and it turned out that their Mum wasn’t ready so we just watched crazy slides.

5pm

Their Mum and Dad came, and I played the piano for them and Tony said,” next time you’re up here, I’ll have you playing up at the pub and I’ll give you $25 an hour and an Ice-cream an hour.” And I’m like, “ I could do it for $0 an hour!”

7pm

Me, Dad and Tony went up to the lookout to see the sunset and we did a hyper lapse and it hit 10 minutes 38 seconds and la la la (whatever makes the dodgy phone call sound) Mum’s call interrupted the thing and I’m like damn that.

8pm

We had dinner and it was THE BEST. Pizza. Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. And by the way, Felix got a colouring pad and I got (for my birthday) a minion. Then soon after, we went to our last sleep in Bingara.

Saturday, 19th of December 2020

7am

We were up early and we had toast and we were packed up.

9am

We are leaving and we went down to the old tree near the bridge and we went to the petrol station to get some oil and Dad needed to go to the toiled and we went to the Bingara markets and we got 98 pencils and 7 metal cars for a savvy $4. Then, surprisingly, we say Tony and that was our final goodbye.

10am

We hit the road with 576km to home. Heading to Tamworth. 576km, up the road mate! I’ve been used to long trips.

1pm

We got to Tamworth in no time. 2hrs. sad we couldn’t go to the Golden Guitar .

3pm

We got to Burning Mountains and my god there was a heap of flies there and sad that Dad was waring grey because flies are attracted to grey, and he got a whole lot of flies on his back. It was a 4km return. And it smelt like sulfur. YUK.

4pm

We are hitting the road back home, 398km. Not long.

7:40pm

We are only 26km from home and we are really excited to open the pencils and cars and play the piano. (The piano sounds different when you haven’t played it for a while.)

8pm
We are going to be eating out tonight and I am very happy.

9pm

We are at home! Home, sweet home. That is the end of the camping trip.
