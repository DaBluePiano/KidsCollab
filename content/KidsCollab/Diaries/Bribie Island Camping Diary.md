## 19-27 January 2023

## Friday 20 January

0800  We‚Äôre just finishing tidying up and we‚Äôre almost ready to go! We managed to fit two scooters in the car. It was better than I thought. Not as packed as last time. I‚Äôm so excited!

0815	We‚Äôre leaving now to Bulahdelah!

0830  And now for our Itinerary today. We‚Äôre heading to Bulahdelah, then to Taree for lunch then to Nambucca Heads than staying at Coffs Harbour for a night.

0914	We just had breakfast, the first Maccas in a long time.

0922   We enter the Pacific Motorway hon the way to Bulahdelah!

1049	We are at Beresfield more than halfway to Buladelah! Stopping for the servo at BP Beresfield and heading to the A1.

1109 	We are passing through Raymond Terrace and there are a lot of warehouses here! Going straight through the Giant roundabout!

1142  	Miles and miles of Highway with only trees and grass around us. Just passed Myall Lakes NP.

1151  	We exit the highway via the Bulahdelah way exit.

1225	We visited the Big Koala in front of the hotel and went to Oliver‚Äôs Bulahdelah.

1303	We went to the skate park, which was incredibly fun, until it rained üòê

1316 	We‚Äôre back on the highway heading to Taree for lunch about 70 to Taree.

1353	We‚Äôre hopping off the highway for Taree for lunch.

1450	We had Vietnamese for lunch which was good. And we‚Äôre going to pass by the Big Oyster. We‚Äôre going to head to the accommodation now.

1500   Slight change of plans and pens, we are heading to the Big Axe first then hopefully to our accommodation!

1544	We visited the information centre and we never expected there to be free coffee for drivers.

1715  	We are just back from the Nambucca heads lookout which was really cool. You could see the whole of Nambucca and, I saw where we went last time! About 30 min from here to our caravan park for tonight.

1801 	We have arrived at the Clog Barn which we have gone to visit before, but not to stay in for a night.

1816 	We were assigned the closest cabin to the reception (Cabin 33). We are now going shopping for essentials.

1901 	We‚Äôre just finished shopping and going back to our cabin for dinner which is instant noodles.

2130	We had instant noodles and chicken from Woolies. The chicken was awesome (as expected) and played a few Card games with my mum. I‚Äôm now heading to sleep on the top bunk!

<br></br>

## Saturday 21 January

0734   I just woke up, it‚Äôs been not the best night sleep, but I‚Äôve been looking forward to what is ahead for us today.

0818	We are now heading off to see the Big Prawn and eventually get to our campsite and also arrive in Brisbane. I haven‚Äôt been to Queensland before to this is going to be really exciting.

1012 	We have arrived in Ballina and the prawn is giant! It looks so realistic!

1045	There is one thing though, I noticed with the Big Prawn. There is no way to get up to the door! There is a door on the body of the prawn which I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs used for. Anyways, we are heading off to lunch in Tweed Heads.

1115  	The way to Byron Bay Lighthouse is very bumpy and has many potholes. We had a dashcam attached to our car which automatically started recording the emergency video. üòÇ

1347 	We are just back from the Lighthouse, and it was really windy up there and we also saw the most Easterly point of Australian mainland. It was for me at least, unusual to see people from France, UK and even the US here. I guess that‚Äôs what tourist attractions are for. Now, we are heading for the servo and then to the place we are staying, Sandstone Point Holiday Resort in Brisbane.

1410[1]	Yes, we have crossed the NSW/QLD border and you can see Tweed Heads and Rainbow Beach at the same time. We now have an extra hour! We are now going to have something to eat, maybe sandwiches.

1528	We are about to leave The Strand at Coolangatta, we just had sandwiches and hot cross buns and heading to our caravan park with about 120 kms to go.

1620	Queensland highways are a bit different from NSW because they have a lot of variable speed limit signs, their construction speed is 60 instead of 40, and they actually number their exits. üôÉ

1749	There is a lot of congestion here, awfully close to Brisbane but another 90 to Sandstone Point.

1754	We have turned off the highway off exit 152A and we‚Äôre only 21 kms left! I‚Äôm so excited to see where we are staying.

1840	We arrived at the holiday resort, and it is so big that we couldn‚Äôt find our campsite! My parents got a wristband RFID tag to get in. The reception staff were really kind.

1900   We‚Äôve just finished setting up the tent which took a long time. We had instant noodles again and had a shower. We‚Äôre going to sleep now.

<br></br>

## Sunday 22 January

0746  We had woken up and just finished looking around the campsite. We are having breakfast outside!

0820  We are about to leave for breakfast and also go to the Brisbane Gardens[2] with my aunt. We should be back by around 3 pm. The facilities at Sandstone Point are surprisingly good. Their toilets are clean and all that. Though there is something unusual. On the pool rules sign, it says No Jumping, No Diving, No Glass, and No Splashing. That last one, No Splashing, was unusual. Doesn‚Äôt everyone go to the pool for a ‚Äòsplash‚Äô? We also forgot to bring torches, so our kind neighbour supplied us a light for the night. We are going to have to buy another torch today when we are out.

0911 	We have just finished Breakfast at CJ‚Äôs Pastries. The pies had a lot of meat in them definitely, excellent value and great taste!

1453	We are just finished at the gardens. The garden was so good! There were a lot of diverse types of plants and there was even a section with cacti and desert plants. There are spiders hanging everywhere!

1545	We‚Äôve just finished with our cousins, and we have to retrace our route back which you probably don‚Äôt want to do. There are ups and downs, unsealed roads. I was getting sick of it.

1715  	We‚Äôve just come out of Bunnings for lights, and it wasn‚Äôt a really good one. It was the most expensive Bunnings trip ever! We had to get another battery just for the tent light! $169! I hope we are heading back soon!

1835	We‚Äôve just returned to our campsite, and we‚Äôve sadly come a back a bit late for the water park which closes at 7 pm. Anyway, the first thing to do was to prepare for dinner. It‚Äôs either pasta or burger.

1945	We‚Äôve just had our dinner which was pasta. It was a delicious meal considering we are outside in the tent.

2048   I‚Äôve just come back from exploring the games room. I really hoped to play ping pong there, but people were already there. There are a lot of bugs at the front of our tent. It was not okay with me and there were also a few bugs inside! Our new light works out really well and isn‚Äôt showing any signs of flickering. RYOBI might be one the more expensive end of tools, but it definitely is worth it was it can last a long time.

2235   We are about to go to sleep after a good shower and we are supposed to go to Bribie Island and have a lot of time set aside for water activities and just staying at the pool. And one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that in the morning, a lot of cars were leaving when I noticed that Queensland started school tomorrow. Now that the park is a little emptier, we can enjoy more of the facilities!

## Monday 23 January

0845   I woke up a little while ago and we just went to the reception for a favour for us to move our tent closer to the amenities and kitchen. We have a pretty long walk to our kitchen. We have a pretty long walk to our kitchen and amenities. So, there was only one spot that was classified as small, powered campsite and it was the one diagonal to us, which wasn‚Äôt really helpful. So, we checked if there were any difference in price between a small, powered camping site and a regular one. It turned out that there was no difference! So, they gave us a few choices, so we chose 132 which was the closest to the amenities. We have to now move the tent four rows down, so we are staying at the campsite for the entire day! Breakfast was really good, especially the Nutella. It was bread and Nutella. It turned out to be exceptionally good with milk. Anyways, we‚Äôd better start moving!

1050   It was really tiring work! Some parts were impossible to pin because there were overflow concrete under the grass! üòê

1732 	We had just finished at the pool. It was so fun that we went down 65 times of the slide individually. We tried to work out the most aerodynamic way to go down the slide. The slide was at last 4m tall, and we got down in 7 seconds! Anyway, the pools had several types of water: Freshwater, Saltwater and Chlorinated Water. The sap was very warm and there was also a swim up bar! We are now booked for tennis from 6-7! I don‚Äôt think I would have enough energy even to play! We had a box of chips which were really salty, there were small cabanas and small half open rooms!

2107	I came back from tennis, and it was great fun. They had actually decent racquets there. We also had gone karts earlier in the day, which was also pretty fun, but it was very tiring. We had dinner which was homemade burgers. After dinner, we went to the ping pong table, which was fortunate to have not one there, but a little unfortunate to know that there were only one and a half paddles. Anyway, we almost got the only ball missing, which was unfortunate, but we eventually got it back! Today was really fun as we could stay that the caravan park today. We‚Äôll get a good night‚Äôs sleep to get to Brisbane tomorrow.

<br></br>

## Tuesday 24 January

0915	We just had breakfast which was exactly the same as yesterday, bread and Nutella. We are about to head out to the Sunshine Coast and coming back hopefully before 3pm. It is extremely hot out here! I was sweating before I even got out of the tent! The car should be cooler now as it has the air conditioning on. We are probably going for the pool for our 100th time. Our side of the camp is basically empty.

1015 	We‚Äôve just worked out; we‚Äôve visited a lot of big things. The Big Axe at Kew, The Big Prawn in Ballina, The Big Koala in Bulahdelah, The Wooden Trout also in Buladelah, The Big Oyster in Taree and The Big Strawberry, Macadamia Nut, and Pineapple. That‚Äôs 8 big things!

1204	We‚Äôve just finished at the Big Pineapple and Macadamia Nut which weas really good. Now we are heading to the servo then to the Amaze world nearby.

1228	There was a 1.25L bottled Iced Coffee ‚ÄòIce Breaker‚Äô in the servo apparently Queensland exclusive. Wonder if my dad can actually finish it!

1300	A little disappointment, a family pass to the Amaze world was $110! It was so expensive that we gave it a miss. There was a cool waterfall at the entrance which you could potentially get you really wet.

1325	We‚Äôve just had out lunch which was fish and chips. We ordered chicken salt and they put a lot of it (almost like the whole bag!) and it was so salty. I was needing wat er every bite. We‚Äôre heading to the lighthouse now! The shop that we had fish and ships at also had a convenience store which was pretty nice, so we got Icy Poles considering it was at a reasonable price.

1430	We just went to the Lighthouse Point Cartwright. It was really hot out there and it had a really nice breeze. I also found two decorative glass pebbles on the ground!

1623	We‚Äôre back at the holiday park and we are about to see if the go karts are still available.

1700	It sadly looks like that we can‚Äôt hire go karts because it‚Äôs past 4pm and they only do it on the hour until 5 pm.

1752 	We‚Äôve just hired ping pong stuff for an hour from the reception. They gave us two actual bats and a better orange ping pong ball. A first I hadn‚Äôt adjusted to the new ball as the balls lying around before would not bounce as high.

1830	The campsite looks suddenly a lot fuller now! Just this morning, there were hardly any people there, but now we can even see the amenities!

1920	We‚Äôre having dinner now which is sausages which we brough from ALDI earlier on. Rain is starting to drizzle now. More rain is predicted for Sandstone Point later tonight.

2100	Rain is starting to pelt down and we‚Äôre finding a solution to the water sagging on the roof. So, my dad put a weight which dripped to one of the corners and diagonally lowered the poles which seemed to work. We can‚Äôt have a shower tonight as it‚Äôs just way too wet.

<br></br>

## Wednesday 25 January

0803  We‚Äôve just had breakfast which was small packets of cereal which definitely not enough. 25g?! Anyway, I‚Äôm pretty excited to go to Brisbane today as we are going to take the Queensland trains.

0846   We‚Äôve just left off in the car for Caboolture train station. I wonder what the different from NSW trains. (I also haven‚Äôt been on the NSW trains for a long time lol).

1751  	We‚Äôve just come back from Brisbane, and I couldn‚Äôt take my notebook with me. The Queensland trains are a bit different. They are considerably more expensive ($57.60 for a two-way trip 2 adults and two children, Caboolture to Brisbane). The trains are also newer. There were toilets, which was very much unexpected as in NSW, only long-distance trains had toilets. Anyway, we went to the Queensland we went to the Queensland Museum, and we went to the spark lab, which was a scient activity-type activity for kids. It was really fun as we got to build circuits and do some experiments ourselves. We then went up to level 4 for the discovery out of the museum. It was mainly fauna that were there. There were fossilized animal specimens and stuffed ones too. We had lunch at the museum‚Äôs own Caf√© Muse. We had Dino Nuggies and Chips for lunch for $9.90. The portion was decently sized for that price. They were just right, not too salty, and not too salty?! We then went to the State Library. The State Library was so huge we almost lost each other! There were many reference books although I could not find any normal fiction or nonfiction books. We first went to the music section. They had an uncountable amount of music sheet books. I also saw microfilm, which I still am not really sure what they are for, but they are somehow connected to magazines and some dates all the way back to the mid-1900s! We walked on a really long foot bridge and were confronted with the Seven wheel of Brisbane and a sea of orange electric hire scooters. We unfortunately could not go on the actual wheel as it was very dear. We went further down to the South Bank coast, but not all the way up to the beach. So, we then took the train back considering the time and that it would take us 1 how to get to Sandstone Point, (and phone batteries!) We took the train to central then on the Caboolture/Nambour line. The train., I should also mention, was considerably slower than Sydney‚Äôs rail network. They are building a metro for Brisbane under construction. Halfway through the trip, we had to experience a 15-minute delay because of a faulty train ahead of us. We got back to Caboolture safely (because we don‚Äôt really know Queensland Rails. We‚Äôre heading back to Sandstone Point now after a whole day at Brisbane. This is our last full day in Queensland ‚òπ. The coast of Queensland is the best!

<br></br>

## Tuesday 26 January

0818	I‚Äôve woken up and having breakfast now, it‚Äôs packaged cereal and bread. We‚Äôre set to have to pack the tent and eventually say goodbye to our holiday resort.

0934   I‚Äôm literally sweating my head off. It‚Äôs so hot out here and we‚Äôve just finished doing the pack and we actually managed to fit everything into the somewhat small car we have.

1035	There is a really big traffic jam here. A lot of people are trying to get out and a lot of people are trying to get in. It‚Äôs actually Australia Day today, so to my assumption, everyone wants to take a 4-day weekend at either a caravan park or at the beach.

0844   We are about to head to our aunt‚Äôs house to have morning tea. About an hour drive there

1038	We actually passed the same Bunnings that we went to buy7 the light. We‚Äôre almost there.

1159 	We‚Äôve just finished at our aunt‚Äôs place. They had a lot of junk on their street! We are now heading to the Tweed for a break.

1230	We‚Äôre set for another 378 kilometres on the highway and 928 kilometers to Sydney. Luckily, we are staying at the Coffs at the Clog Barn again today. We‚Äôre also going to lose one hour too!

1329	We have just finished getting something to eat, we‚Äôve just had Ice Cream which was Italian, and we didn‚Äôt even know what the flavor was! The whole box was in Italian. All we knew about it was that it was Ice Cream

1353	Lunch was Ham and Cheese Rolls and grapes.

1607[3]   We‚Äôre back in NSW. We‚Äôve just lost one hour. About 2 and a half hours to Coffs.

1742 	We put on the built int Car GPS which was from 2008 so we could see if it can lead us home just for tun. It doesn‚Äôt register the Pacific Highway. It wants us to go to the Old Pacific Highway! We would get home at 2:41 am at this rate, but obviously we aren‚Äôt going straight home! We‚Äôre staying over at Coffs tonight. About 40 minutes to do.

1829	We are at Coffs Harbour and we‚Äôre heading to the Jetty for a walk. We passed the place that we stayed last year earlier.

1945      	We‚Äôve finished walking and riding on the Historic Jetty. It was very bumpy, almost busted a screw! We also took photos of the stunning sunset. It‚Äôs so beautifully read and orange! We‚Äôre heading to the Clog Barn for dinner and sleep.

2000  We‚Äôve got assigned Cabin 38 which was further down than we stayed last time. It was expected to look like semi-old like last week, but I got really surprised because it was actually relatively new. It looks way better than Cabin 33. It has an aircon!

2100	We‚Äôre having dinner now, which is instant noodles and also watching the women‚Äôs semifinals at AO23.

2203   I‚Äôm about to go to sleep, and we have our own lights on the bunker bed and I‚Äôm sleeping on the top again.

<br></br>

## Friday 27 January

0815	I‚Äôve just woken up and we‚Äôre about to have b breakfast which is cereal (again!)

0942   We‚Äôve left the Clog Barn, bought curry sauce, apple sauce, a manet and a bus. We‚Äôve just fueled up on the cheapest petrol that we‚Äôve seen in NSW for a long time, 166.9/L, We‚Äôre on the hunt for Allen‚Äôs frosty fruits loll things. We‚Äôre now heading to Kmart and the Info Centre (Hopefully) for my high school uniform.

1030	It turns out they don‚Äôt have the uniform we were looking for. But we did get Ice Cubes tray that we found very convenient as you could pop the ice from the silicone base. The clog barn cabin had the same one! Actually, I still have a few pieces of ice in my bottle right now!

1050   We‚Äôve hit the road bound to home in about 5 Hours (without stopping) The old car map would take a few hours more to get back!

1316 	We‚Äôve just had lunch (I had no idea where we had lunch), we had nuggets and chips while the adults had burgers. The chicken nuggets were actually the same Dino nuggets we had at Caf√© Muse in Queensland Museum. Their chips were ever so slightly thinner, but they still gave a generous amount. We are heading home now. About 3 hours and 34 minutes to go. We are actually close to Sydney than we are to Ballina!

1454	We‚Äôve come back to Buladelah where we came the first day. We took another family photo at the Big Koala and also went to eh skate park like last time. About 2 and a half hours until home. It‚Äôs still very hot our here, I really hope it will become cooler and I don‚Äôt even mind a rain!

1537	We‚Äôre just passing Kew Castel and only 169 kilometers to go now! You get used to long distances when you go long distances. Return trip from Bribie Island to Sydney is about 2000 km!

1658	We‚Äôve just turned off the highway into Normanhurst, we‚Äôre almost there! I recognize all of the roads now.

1721  	With many turns, the box and bag keep falling on us. ‚òπ

1724 	We‚Äôre finally home! After a very long trip. Actually, it was my longest trip within Australia!

<br></br>

## Summary

Queensland was a great experience! It was similar to NSW expect that it was either really bad or perfect! I really like the coast of Queensland where you can see the ocean most of the time and there is a fresh breeze which is good when it‚Äôs hot!  It was really fun to go on the new activities and the long drive was definitely work it! A highlight has to be the Queensland Rail network as there were major difference between the NSW ones. The City of Brisbane is so big and awesome that we didn‚Äôt get to see the whole city. ‚òπÔ∏è But, nevertheless, I learned a lot from Queensland. It‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs the best holiday that I‚Äôve been on!
