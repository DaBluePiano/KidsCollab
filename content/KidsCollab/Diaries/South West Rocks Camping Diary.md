South West Rocks Camping Diary  

By Sidney L

16 December 2021 – 21 December 2021

Thursday 16 December 2021

0737 – It’s the morning of the 16th of December and we are packing up for the trip to South West Rocks. I am excited. Let’s all hope that everything goes well.

0805 – We’re heading off (finally!) to our friend’s house where we are going to discuss how we are going to get there and the route to get there.  

0904 – We have just left our friend's house and we are getting up and packed. We have loaded at least another 3kg of stuff. Our friend’s car is following behind us the whole way. Our first stop is Raymond Terrace 159 kilometres with a 1-hour 58-minute drive.

0934 – We are on the A1 Motorway which we’ll be on for 126 kilometres (which is admittedly very long.)

1005 – We are on the A1 for a while now. It’s getting a bit boring now.  

1015 – We are going to be off on a toilet break in the mid of the trip to Raymond Terrace.

1030 – We have just come back from the rest and are heading back into the A1. Our family and our friend’s family felt like the only people that were wearing face masks. We thought it was safer to wear masks anyway even though Dominic Perrottet announced no masks mandatory about midday yesterday.  

1130 – We are at the park in Raymond Terrace where we are going to have lunch.  

1226 – We finished lunch. It was delicious. There were sausages, meat and fruit! We are on the way to our campsite which is at South West Rocks.  

1314 – We are still on the A1 and we are heading to the petrol station for a fill-up.  

1334 – We have arrived at the petrol station, BP Coolongolook. It seems a weird name, isn’t it?

1350 – We have just finished pumping oil and gas now. We are heading to the caravan park with just about 2 hours left.  

1535 – We are very close to our campsite, which is about 15 kilometres, and I am super pumped about it. It has just started raining quite lightly.  

1552 – We’re here! I am going to jump around in happiness.  

1600 – We’re setting up our tents, and Dad’s time lapses the tent build. We had to help with the setting up of the tents. It was boring. Since it was so hot, we wanted to go to the pool.  

1750 – We’re in the pool! (finally) there are so many cool attractions. I could immediately tell that the theme for this park was pirates. There were so many things to play on! This was very exciting, and I knew that there were many more exciting things to come.  

1901 – I have just come out of the shower and I am blasted., I am too tired. I sat down and we had dinner. Tonight’s dinner was dumplings made by my friend’s grandma. It was delicious. It had a very different style to the ones we had at home. The ones at home were crunchy and bitter, and the ones that I ate just then were tender and sweet.  

1950 – We’ve finished dinner and it’s starting to rain. We’re riding bikes around our block. Our inflatable mattress is pumped and we’re ready to go to sleep.  

2015 – I just finished 8 rounds of the block on the scooter and I am really tired.  

2042 – We were going to be going to the beach, but we realized that it was way too dangerous out there at night.  

2105 – We are in our tent and are getting ready to sleep. Today has been a very exciting day. It was filled with fun even though we spent most of the day on the road.

Friday 17 December 2021

0650 – It’s another morning, and everyone is waking up to rain. Rain just bags up on top of tents and they can become quite heavy. During the night, I went to the toilet, and I saw a family of kangaroos about 15 meters away from our tent. I knew what was going to happen. They were going to our tent to look around and since there was no food to eat (we covered it up ‘cause we’re smart), they would poop on the ground, and we would have to pick it up. Well, my prediction was correct. We had to clean up the messy floor dotted with kangaroo poop. The whole tarp floor was wet. I didn’t think we could have breakfast here at all. It was just too wet.  

0730 – Breakfast was good. I mean it was so good that I wanted another one, but I could not fit it. It was toast with cheese, mushroom, tomatoes and avocado. I am going to go for a walk, on a scooter and go on the jumping pillow.

0930 – Ugh. It is raining fairly heavily, and we have swapped our day with Sunday in which we stay at the campsite the whole day. This. Is. Unfair. Sunday is a good day which means we can go Go-karting and putt-putt. Since now it is raining, we probably wouldn’t be able to go Go-karting anymore. ☹  

1017 – I have spent quite a long time just sitting here doing practically nothing. It has just finished raining and we are planning to go to the pool later. Maybe 1030.

1155 – I have just finished playing Ping-Pong with my friends and we are waiting for lunch right now. We are going to the pool after lunch! Yay! My mum said that every afternoon, we will go I not the polo for a swim. I am so excited for the days to come.  

1258 – We have just finished lunch and it was amazing. It was instant ramen noodles. I ate 2 and a half bowls. I am full. We’re going to the pool now!

1635 – I’ve just come up out of the water and it was so fun! Nothing could be that today. I am really tired now. We’re going to eat something and go scootering again.  

1835 – I’ve just finished having dinner. It wasn’t a gourmet meal, but for camping, oh yeah it was. We had pork, spinach, mushrooms and some bread altogether. It was yum. We always have good meals here.  

2109 – We went for a very short bushwalk just out of the campsite. We are eating a late feast and I have finished going to brush my teeth. We are getting ready for bed.

2130 – We have just come into the tent, and it is dark. I don’t know why. So, I am using a heavy-duty torch to light the tent up. Today has been uphill and downhill. This morning was boring, and the afternoon was exciting. I am looking forward to tomorrow when we go to Nambucca Heads. It is also my brother Felix’s birthday tomorrow.  

Saturday 18 December 2021

0650 – I have just woken up to a very beautiful sunny morning. We are going Go-karting at 0800 and we are going to be celebrating my brother’s birthday today! Today is going to be an exciting day! Yay!

0850 – We have booked a Go-Kart and we have just gone out and played with the scooter and the bikes. We are just eating Doritos. No one knows why.

1016 – We’ve just finished Go-karting and it was both extremely fun and tiring at the same time. We are just about to head out to Nambucca Heads at the beach. I am extremely hot right now. We hired 2 double Go-karts so that 4 people can ride at a time. I had to drive all by myself because Brian could not drive because he was only 4 years old.  

1030 – We are packing up for Nambucca Heads which is 67 kilometres away and a 55-minute drive. It was kind of shorter than I thought. For some reason, I think we are in the middle of nowhere since if you go out of the park, you can only see trees and forests and you cannot see any things like shopping centres and stuff like that.  

1058 – We’re in the car on the way to Nambucca Heads and it seems like I am wrong and there is a whole town out here! We are actually on the very east of the town of South West Rocks.

1145 – We are at Nambucca Heads, and it looks beautiful. The beach is very bright can the water is as clear as can be.  

1330 – We have just finished one of the biggest lunches I have ever had. We had chips, fish, calamari and prawns. It was overly delicious.  

1430 – We have just finished looking at the V-Wall. The V-Wall is composed of big rocks that people write and draw on. It is situated on the coast of Nambucca Heads in a V-Shape, hence the name/. We are going to go to the lookout at the top of the hill now.  

1445 – We are on the lookout, and it is quite high up. We are literally on the beach top. It’s amazing. We are going to head to the South West Rocks Shopping Centre.

1610 – We have just arrived at the South West Rocks Shopping Centre and within 10 minutes in Coles, there was an evacuation sound that told us to come out because there was a fire. We will have to move to the closest IGA, IGA South West Rocks.

1640 – We have just gone out of the IGA, and we bought Felix two cakes to share between us 9 people.

1700 – We have arrived back, and we are going to be going into the pool right now. It seemed so long since we were here.  

1830 – I’ve just come out of the pool, and I feel very relieved in a way. We are going to ride around and do stuff such as going into the playground.

2012 – We have just finished our dinner and it was Spaghetti Bolognese. It was really good.  

2100 – We are having the cake now. It is getting heated up, so, to pass time, we got party poppers and those flickering thingies that are lit on a metal stick that you hold. Both of them were scary to me, but I managed to play with the flickering sticks somehow.  

2146 – After the cake, we are getting ready for bed, and we are right now in the tent. Today was quite exciting and fun-filled. It was also quite tiring. I am looking toward tomorrow when we are going to our local beaches.

Sunday 19 December 2021

0700 – I have just woken up, pretty late today because I got sunburnt at the pool yesterday and I also have a headache. We are probably going to the beach and going swimming. I am pretty sure I’m not going there today. Our breakfast is a very simple one, just toast and fruit. It was really good.

1007 – We are doing some sport outside in the backyard. It is really fun. It was quite hot so we’re having yoghurt. We also played 毽子 (jiàn zi) and skipping ropes.  

1314 – Lunch was good. It was sandwiches with turkey. We are now heading to our local beach in South West Rocks.  

1407 – We have arrived at the lighthouse. There is quite a good view from up here. You can see the ocean from up here.  

1501 – It was quite windy out there, 158 meters above sea level. It was also quite cold out there. We are now going to the Trial Bay Gaol, which in old English, means Trial Bay Jail.  

1631 – We just went to the Trial Bay Gao in Arakoon, and it was very interesting and at some times, it became a little scary. We learnt about life in the Gao and the routines there. I was knowledge-filled and it was quite cool. The very interesting thing that happened was that while we were shopping for souvenirs, the whole town of Arakoon had a blackout, which meant the lights and electricity in the souvenir shop was off.  

1717 – We have just finished going to the beach and we mainly played in the sand. We made a Y-shaped formation, which meant that there were three entries for water to go in and the water collected together like a dam. It was very fun. We dug at least 1 meter underground.  

1821 – Wow! What a meal! We ate outside for the first time in two years! We had an Italian meal with pizza and pasta. We ate at Paragon Pizzeria in South West Rocks. We ordered Hawaiian pizza, Meat Lover pizza, and Mexican Jalapeno pizza. We ordered a family size that was 15”! (38.1 centimetres.) We ate a fair lot., I had 4 pieces of pizza, 4 pieces of garlic bread and 3 bowls of pasta.  

1830 – We arrived at the campsite and we’re planning to go swimming in the pool.  

1945 – It was good in the pool. We played teams in which we hide an object (in this case, a plastic diamond that we found in the pool yesterday.) and hide it as sneakily as possible and make the other team find it. On one team, there were Felix and Sarah, and on the other team, there were Janice and me. We hid first and we lodged the diamond in the top of the blue slide. We gave them clues that turned out to be false. Now the other team is angry at us because they could not find it and they said that we did everything wrong, and we wasted their time, and they didn’t do anything wrong.

Monday 20 December 2021

0715 – I have just woken up to a cool, sunny day. This is probably the coolest day ever at camping so far. We are going to Port Macquarie which is about 1 hour south of here. We are also going to the Bago Maze and the ‘Timbertown’ there. This will be exciting.  

0830 – We have just finished having breakfast and it was the leftovers from yesterday and some eggs. It was surprising how the pizza was still good after it was microwaved. (If you’ve ever tried microwaving pizza, it always becomes soggy☹.)  

1015 – We’re heading off to Bago to go to the maze and the winery. I hope the maze has clues!

1335 – We have just finished at the Bago Maze, and we were sweating way too much and there were sadly no clues. It was very swirly unless some places weren’t. The Mayfield Gardens one was straight and had clues. This one was way harder. Anyway, we bought some mini fruit sweets and they had cute designs on them. I wonder how they do it.  

1430 – We still haven’t had lunch and we’re burning hot. We’re planning not to go to Port Macquarie Subway on 8 Clarence Street.  

1615 – We have just finished lunch at Subway, and we had a quick 10-minute shop for the things that we are going to have tonight. Since I was so hungry, I had a foot-long sub with cheese and ham. It turned out that Timbertown closed. After all, we were too late to get there because we took too long on Bago Maze. ☹

1900 – We’ve just finished the last day at the pool and it was really fun. Sarah and I hosted a challenged on doing flips in the water. She won most of them because she does gymnastics, and she can do the splits and I can’t. (I at least won 12 of them 😛) Brian and I went to the slides 46 times because he wanted to, and I had to supervise him because he is very young. We are probably going to have dinner soon.

2222 – We have finished dinner which was Hokkien noodles and lamb. It was quite yummy. We are ready to sleep for the last time out camping.

Tuesday 21 December 2021

0725 – I’ve just woken up and we’re already starting to pack up! I deflated the ‘self-inflating’ bed air mattress that I slept on, and I also deflated the high-pressure air mattress. We also packed up the chairs outside and the table too. I still don’t know when and what we’ll have breakfast. We’re having a long trip ahead!

0938 – We’ve finished packing up. Breakfast was cheese and toast and turkey. It’s probably the easiest one ever. We are on the road to Timbertown (Again) to go have a look at the trains. And we’re also heading back on the way.  

1057 – We’ve arrived in Timbertown, and we are going to go in and have fun. Hope everything is well. It must be very interesting.  

1444 – We’ve come out of Timbertown, and boy was that fun! We got to ride 3 things: The big ‘wood-powered’ train, the small ‘tractor-powered’ thingy, and the small ‘horse-powered’ thingy (it must have been quite fast, right? (*Get it?*) We also met a Blacksmith who was good at dad jokes like this: “Do you have an iPad? Well, I’ll tell you what, there were ‘i-pads’ back then in the olden days. (Then, he shows us an eye pad which covers your eye and cleanses your eye when there is dirt in it)” We laughed like never before. He also made king cobras with steel rods. We then went to the most exciting part of Timbertown (for me and Sarah at least) which was the gold sifting. It seemed so easy, but it was quite hard. We actually could keep the stuff we found. It was cool. In the end, we were given a small bag to put the stuff that we found and wanted to keep in. We found Green Jasper, Amethyst, Quartz, Spessartite (which was quite special) and something that weighed 5 grams that looked like gold. We also had nuggets and chips for lunch. We are heading back home now.  

1740 – We’re approaching The Entrance and we’re at the last petrol on the motorway for a fill-up and go to the toilets.  

1920 – We have come out of the motorway, and we are 10 minutes until home. We are going to have instant noodles when we get back.  

1932 – We are back at our house, and it has been quite a long trip.  

The End!

Summary

This trip was amazing. It was one of the best I’ve ever been through. There were ups and downs throughout the journey, but I can tell you that more than half were ups! We also went into the pool 5 days in a row! (Did you realize it in my diary?) The holiday was fully packed with amazing activities like going to Trial Bay Gaol and the Bago Maze and Winery. We also shared some new experiences too! I haven’t gone in the pool for at; east 2 years since I stopped swimming lessons. My favourite part of this trip is going to Timbertown. There were so many olden-day things there. You could even pan for Gold and other gemstones! We found a lot of stuff there. My least favourite part of the trip was being in the car for a long time, like 4 hours in one go because my legs always have pins and needles when I go off the car.
