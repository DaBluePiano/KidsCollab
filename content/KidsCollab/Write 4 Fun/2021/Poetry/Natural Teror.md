Light bursts through the trees

Pouring ashes in the seas.

Glowing embers have no singing

But hear the death, destruction, cackling.

Onward, heat surges through the land

Miss the clearing - a small band

Of animals, chiming with tales of home

An orchestra of sorrow, a melancholy tome.

Pillars of smoke circle the sky

The creatures wait for safety, by and by

Then, as the sun puts the terror to sleep

The animals emerge, with a flight, a crawl, a leap.

To embrace the aftermath of what happens every year

And to take in the beautiful, mourning silence they hear.
