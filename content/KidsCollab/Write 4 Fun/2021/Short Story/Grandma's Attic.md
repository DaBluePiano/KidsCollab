As I stepped down the steps, one by one, the creaks echoed across the stairway. When I reached the bottom of the steps, a loud creak welcomed me. The door was damaged with cracks in it. As I opened the door, a burst of cold air hit me.

In the attic

Inside the room, it was very chilli and there was lots of stuff. There were old clothes, evil looking dolls and some books. I couldn’t see well so I grabbed an old, dusty lantern. I looked around. I saw more stuff in the corner of the attic. There, I saw some more books. But then, one of the books moved a little. I picked up the book that had moved and under it, there was a doll. I thought, “It must have been a mouse.”

The not so scary doll…

But I was wrong. There wasn’t any sign of a mouse but there was a trail of cotton that filled up the doll. Then, the doll shifted again. This time it moved its mouth. It was grinning an evil grin and was looking at me like it was going to attack any moment.

Destroy Earth…

The evil doll then muttered, “Destroy earth.” Then, I got a good idea. What was it? “RUNNNNN!!!” The doll chased after me and called for back-up.

Soon, dolls poured out of every corner of the attic.

Call for back-up…

Some of the dolls were holding knives or some were holding base ball bats! This is a great team but I’m not in them. Sad. Anyways, where were we? Oh yeah. There was soon an army of doll helicopters hovering above me.

Just a dream…

I was just about to die when I woke up and figured out that it was just a dream. Just then, I heard a sound coming from the attic. “Destroy earth…” Maybe that’s for another story. Here we go again!!!

The End
Or is it?
