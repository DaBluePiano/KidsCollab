Ever since the mothership has placed abductors all over the Island things have been uneasy like people have been abducted at least twice a week. Although all the messages that are saying to stay at home people are marching through the streets screaming “Take us with you”. So far, the people who have been abducted but never came back include Dr. Slone, Abstrackt, Sunny, Hayseed and sunflower.

Not only have people been taken but the aliens have dropped off a few people as well like Zyg and Choppy who are alien outlaws, Joey who his trying to make peace with humans, and countless trespassers who are always moving around the Island so no one can predict where the next battlefield will be. When I say battlefield, I mean that we are in a war now. The war started when Dr. Slone Got taken away by the mothership and while she is in there, she is sending alien technology that she can get her hands on. She has also sent the IO Guards pulse rifles.

So far, she has sent Railguns, Recon scanners, zyg and choppy ray guns and Kemara ray guns so hopefully we can have the upper hand in the war. To get these weapons for the war thought you need to fight the aliens. Which is hard since they have many allies in the war like the people who have been taken because now, they are under the control of the aliens held hostage because if they try to escape, they will be zapped with one of their most evil weapons a modified taser now capable of stunning an elephant or even enough to stop a bus. Which would give humans severe burns.

The mothership has already been taking areas on the Island to try to make us surrender to get our land back from the mothership.

The aliens and the IO have signed an agreement that on the 13th of September the war would be fully over, but we would not get all your land back so that would mean that we must do a lot of Constuction after the war so that we would be safe if we do end up in another war but only time will tell if that is true hopefully no one starts a new war soon.
