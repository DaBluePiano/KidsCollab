Glaring down on me, the ever so large ball of fire known as our sun gave us the hottest recorded day of the decades. On the torn seat of old Volvo bus, I could feel a small wire prod me in the back, harder each time we drove over a divot in the poorly constructed road. As I wearily gazed out of the window, shrivelled and frayed bushes casually rolled along the dusty surface. I allowed myself to doze of for 1 minute, which became 2, then 5 and so on.

I woke to the screeching of rusty brakes and shuffling of scuffed shoes. When I stepped out of the bus, I instantly could feel the sweltering heat, slapping me in the face. Each and every step was more agonising as the last as I slowly strutted out into the desert, unsure of where I was going.

In no time at all, I could look in any direction, only to be met with the same view. Aware of the risk of hallucinating, I decided to focus on finding a water source. It was my only chance of staying sane. In military training we were taught survival skills, so I had to tap into the back of my brain to find what I should do.

After countless, painful hours, I finally had my sight set on a distant oasis. I looked hundreds of kilometres away, and it was already dark, but I had to keep on moving. Fighting back sweat and tears of pure exhaustion, my weary legs slowly turned over to make my way closer and closer to the oasis. To make maters worse, my long and scratchy cargo pants had started to chafe, and every step was like lighting a match against my thighs. Pushing onwards, my tired and weak body had been pushed to a limit, and then pushed on further. It was giving in.

Waking to the caw of a cockatoo, the sweltering sun had risen up again. I wondered how long I had been out for, but then saw my destiny of water and focused on staying alive. I reached the edge of my side of the canyon, only to be met by a 3m jump, with a 250m fall if I were to fail. I had to do this. My legs had just received a rush of energy. It was my only chance. I sprinted in, with good stride and strong power. I reached the edge and launched myself over thin air.

Crunch! I felt hard dirt rattle my shins. I looked up to sky, only to see it glitch. What? Then a voice filled the lonely plains of the dessert.

“Congratulations test subject A17B6. You have passed your first trial. You will now need to complete 5 others. Good luck, and happy jumping”
